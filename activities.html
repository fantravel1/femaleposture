    <h2>The Activity Principle</h2>
    <div class="content-block">
      <p>No single posture is perfect if held for hours. The healthiest approach involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Alternate between sitting, standing, and moving</li>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Take breaks every 30-60 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Notice when you've drifted into poor positions</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Set up each environment to support good posture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guides in this section help you optimize each activity while remembering that movement between activities is just as important.</p>
