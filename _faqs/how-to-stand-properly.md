# How Should I Stand Properly?

- Hip over knee
- Knee over ankle

**From the front:**
- Head centered
- Shoulders level
- Hips level
- Weight equal on both feet

## Key Elements

**Feet:**
- Hip-width apart
- Weight balanced
- Slight knee softness (not locked)

**Pelvis:**
- Neutral (not tilted forward or back)
- Imagine balancing a bowl of water

**Core:**

- Not rolled forward

**Head:**
