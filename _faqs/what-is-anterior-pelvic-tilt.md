# What Is Anterior Pelvic Tilt?

**Quick Answer:** Anterior pelvic tilt (APT) is a postural pattern where your pelvis rotates forward, causing your lower back to arch excessively and your belly to push out. It's very common, especially in women.

## How to Identify It

**Signs of APT:**
- Exaggerated lower back curve
- Belly appears to stick out
- Butt appears to stick out
- Belt line tilts down in front
- Lower back tightness

**The Water Bucket Test:**
Imagine your pelvis is a bucket of water. With APT, water would spill out the front.

- Tight hip flexors (from sitting)

**Contributing Factors:**
- Prolonged sitting
- High heels
- Pregnancy
- Weak core

## Problems It Can Cause
