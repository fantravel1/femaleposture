# How Do I Fix a Hunched Back?

**Quick Answer:** Fix a hunched back by stretching tight chest muscles, strengthening weak upper back muscles, and improving thoracic spine mobility. Daily exercises plus posture awareness can show improvement in 4-8 weeks.

## Key Components

**What's happening:**
- Tight chest (pectorals)
- Weak upper back muscles
- Stiff thoracic spine
- Forward head often accompanies
- Habitual poor positioning

- Child's pose with reach
- Foam roller thoracic extension

## Strengthening Exercises

**Build these muscles:**
- Rows (all variations)
- Face pulls

- Chin tucks

## Thoracic Mobility

**Improve movement:**
