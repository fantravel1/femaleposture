# How Long Does It Take to Fix Anterior Pelvic Tilt?

**Quick Answer:** With consistent daily stretching and strengthening exercises, most people see noticeable improvement in anterior pelvic tilt within 4-8 weeks. Full correction may take 3-6 months depending on severity.

## Timeline Expectations

**Typical progression:**
- 2-4 weeks: Begin to feel changes
- 4-8 weeks: Visible improvement
- 2-4 months: Significant correction
- 3-6 months: Habit becomes natural

## Factors Affecting Timeline

**Faster progress if:**
- Mild tilt to start
- Consistent daily practice
- Good overall flexibility
- No structural issues

**Slower progress if:**
- Severe tilt
- Inconsistent exercise
- Very tight hip flexors
- Sedentary lifestyle

## Essential Exercises

**Daily routine:**
- Hip flexor stretches (2-3 min each side)
- Glute bridges (3x15)
- Dead bugs (3x10 each side)
- Bird dogs (3x10 each side)
- Plank (3x30 seconds)

## Key Stretches

**Focus on:**
- Kneeling hip flexor stretch
- Rectus femoris stretch
- Lower back release

## What Delays Progress

- Stretching without strengthening
- Inconsistent practice
- Continuing poor sitting habits
- Skipping glute work
- Expecting quick fixes

Daily 15-20 minute sessions are more effective than occasional longer sessions.
