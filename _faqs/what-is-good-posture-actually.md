# What Is Good Posture, Actually?

**Quick Answer:** Good posture isn't rigid perfection—it's alignment where your body can function efficiently with minimal strain. It's sustainable, allows easy movement, and doesn't cause pain. Think "tall and relaxed" rather than military stiffness.

## Modern Understanding

**Good posture is:**
- Sustainable without effort
- Allows free movement
- Doesn't cause pain
- Can change and vary
- Natural, not forced

**It's NOT:**
- Rigid perfect alignment
- One fixed position
- Tense holding
- Military attention
- The same for everyone

## General Alignment Principles

**When standing:**
- Ears over shoulders
- Shoulders over hips
- Hips over ankles
- Natural curves present
- Weight balanced

**When sitting:**
- Back supported or engaged
- Feet grounded
- Not slumped
- Able to breathe freely

## The Bigger Picture

**What matters more:**
- Variety of positions
- Regular movement
- Overall strength
- Flexibility
- Body awareness

## Key Insight

No single position is perfect—even "good" posture held too long becomes problematic. The best posture is your next posture. Keep moving, stay aware, and don't obsess over perfection.
