# Why Does My Back Hurt When I Sit?

**Quick Answer:** Sitting puts more pressure on spinal discs than standing, and prolonged sitting causes muscle fatigue, reduced circulation, and compression—all leading to back pain.

## Main Causes of Sitting Back Pain

**1. Disc Pressure**
- Sitting increases disc pressure by 40-90%
- Slouching increases it further
- Compression irritates structures

**2. Muscle Fatigue**
- Back muscles work to hold you up
- Static holding causes fatigue
- Fatigued muscles become painful

**3. Poor Posture**
- Slouching strains ligaments
- Rounded back stretches tissues
- Sustained positions cause stiffness

**4. Lack of Movement**
- Sitting reduces blood flow
- Tissues don't get nutrients
- Stiffness develops

## How to Fix Sitting Back Pain

**Every 30 minutes:**
- Stand and move briefly
- Change positions
- Do a quick stretch

**While sitting:**
- Use lumbar support
- Feet flat on floor
- Hips slightly higher than knees
- Screen at eye level

**Strengthen:**
- Core muscles
- Back extensors
- Glutes

Movement is the best medicine for sitting-related back pain.
