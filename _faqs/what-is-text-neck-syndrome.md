# What Is Text Neck Syndrome?

**Quick Answer:** Text neck is the neck pain, stiffness, and postural damage that results from spending extended time looking down at phones, tablets, and other devices. The head's forward position significantly increases strain on the neck.

## Why It's a Problem

**Head weight increases:**
- Neutral position: ~10-12 lbs on neck
- 15° tilt: ~27 lbs
- 30° tilt: ~40 lbs
- 45° tilt: ~49 lbs
- 60° tilt: ~60 lbs

## Symptoms

**Common signs:**
- Neck pain and stiffness
- Upper back pain
- Shoulder pain
- Headaches
- Reduced neck mobility
- Pain looking up

## Who's at Risk

**Especially common in:**
- Heavy smartphone users
- Teens and young adults
- Remote workers
- Anyone with extended device use
- Gamers

## Prevention

**Smart device use:**
- Raise phone to eye level
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Stretch neck regularly
- Limit overall screen time
- Use voice-to-text

## Treatment

**If you have text neck:**
- Chin tuck exercises
- Neck stretches
- Upper back strengthening
- Posture correction
- Device habit changes

Prevention is easier than treatment—adjust habits before pain develops.
