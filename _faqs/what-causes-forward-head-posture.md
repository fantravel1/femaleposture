# What Causes Forward Head Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Forward head posture develops from prolonged looking down (phones, computers), weak neck/upper back muscles, tight chest muscles, and habitual poor positioning over time.

## Main Causes

**1. Screen Use**
- Looking down at phones
- Computer screen too low
- Hours of forward gazing
- "Text neck" phenomenon

**2. Muscle Imbalances**
- Weak deep neck flexors
- Weak upper back muscles
- Tight chest muscles
- Tight front of neck

**3. Lifestyle Factors**
- Desk work posture
- Driving position
- Reading habits
- Sleeping position

**4. Habit Formation**
- Repeated positions become default
- Brain learns new "normal"
- Body adapts to sustained posture

## Why It Gets Worse

Each inch your head moves forward adds 10+ pounds of effective weight on your neck, causing:
- Muscle fatigue
- Compensatory tightness
- Further forward creep

## How to Reverse It

**Strengthen:**
- Deep neck flexors (chin tucks)
- Upper back muscles (rows)

**Stretch:**
- Chest muscles
- Front of neck

**Change habits:**
- Raise screens to eye level
- Take frequent breaks
- Check position regularly
