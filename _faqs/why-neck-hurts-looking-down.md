# Why Does My Neck Hurt When Looking Down?

**Quick Answer:** Your head weighs 10-12 pounds, but when tilted forward 45-60 degrees (as when looking at a phone), it puts 40-60 pounds of force on your neck muscles, causing strain and pain.

## The Physics

**Head Angle vs. Neck Load:**
- Neutral (0°): ~10-12 lbs
- 15° tilt: ~27 lbs
- 30° tilt: ~40 lbs
- 45° tilt: ~49 lbs
- 60° tilt: ~60 lbs

## Why It Hurts

**The strain:**
- Neck muscles work overtime
- Ligaments stretch
- Discs compress unevenly
- Joints stressed abnormally

**Over time:**
- Muscles fatigue and spasm
- Trigger points develop
- Pain refers to head and shoulders
- Posture worsens

## Common Causes

- Phone use (looking down)
- Laptop on lap
- Reading in bed
- Desk too low
- Computer screen too low

## How to Prevent It

**Device positioning:**
- Phone at eye level
- Screen at eye level
- Books/tablets propped up

**Breaks:**
- Every 20-30 minutes
- Look up and around
- Neck stretches

**Strengthening:**
- Deep neck flexors
- Upper back muscles
