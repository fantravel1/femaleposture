# Can Improving Posture Make You Taller?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, improving posture can make you appear 1-2 inches taller. Poor posture compresses your spine and reduces your standing height. Good posture restores your spine to its natural length—though it doesn't add new height.

## How It Works

**Height restoration:**
- Decompresses spinal discs
- Extends natural curves appropriately
- Lifts head position
- Opens chest
- Lengthens torso appearance

## What You Can Gain

**Realistic expectations:**
- 0.5 to 2 inches typical
- More if posture is very poor
- Immediate visible difference
- Not actual skeletal height change
- Looks more confident too

## Posture Issues That Reduce Height

**Common compressions:**
- Forward head (1/2 inch+)
- Rounded shoulders
- Excessive kyphosis
- Slumped sitting
- Hip flexor tightness

## How to Stand Tallest

**Maximize your height:**
- Stack ears over shoulders over hips
- Reach crown of head up
- Relax shoulders down
- Engage core lightly
- Slight chin tuck
- Even weight on both feet

## Important Note

You're restoring your true height, not adding new height. Someone with excellent posture has already maximized this—they won't gain more. The benefit goes to those whose poor posture currently compresses their spine.
