# Does Core Strength Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Absolutely. Your core muscles are the foundation of posture. They stabilize your spine, control your pelvis, and allow you to maintain upright positions without excessive strain on other structures.

## Core's Role in Posture

**Spinal Stability:**
- Deep core muscles support spine
- Control segmental movement
- Protect spinal structures
- Maintain alignment

**Pelvic Control:**
- Core controls pelvic position
- Prevents excessive tilt
- Creates stable base
- Connects upper and lower body

**Anti-Gravity Support:**
- Holds you upright
- Resists slumping forces
- Reduces back muscle strain
- Enables efficient posture

## Signs of Weak Core

**Posture signs:**
- Lower back arches excessively
- Can't sit up straight long
- Belly pushes forward
- Fatigue quickly when standing

**Physical signs:**
- Lower back pain
- Can't hold plank well
