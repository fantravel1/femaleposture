# How Does Poor Posture Affect Internal Organs?

**Quick Answer:** Slouched posture compresses the thoracic and abdominal cavities, reducing space for organs to function. This can affect lung capacity, digestion, and circulation.

## Effects on Different Systems

**Lungs/Breathing:**
- Compressed chest cavity
- Reduced lung expansion
- Up to 30% less capacity
- Shallow breathing

**Digestive System:**
- Compressed stomach/intestines
- Slower digestion
- Increased reflux risk
- Bloating issues

**Cardiovascular:**
- Compressed vessels
- Reduced circulation
- Heart works harder in compressed position

## The Mechanism

**When slouching:**
- Ribs can't expand fully
- Diaphragm compressed
- Abdomen squished
- Organs have less room
- Function compromised

## Research Shows

- Slumped posture reduces lung function
- Posture affects gastric emptying
- Blood pressure readings affected by position
- Organ position matters for function

## What Helps

**For better organ function:**
- Sit and stand upright
- Open chest
- Allow full breathing
- Don't compress after meals
- Regular movement

## Important Perspective

These effects are from chronic poor posture. Occasional slouching isn't harmful. But hours of daily compression over years can contribute to issues.
