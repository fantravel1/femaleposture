# Can Posture Affect Anxiety?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. Research shows slouched posture is associated with increased negative emotions and stress, while upright posture can reduce anxiety, improve mood, and increase resilience to stress.

## The Research

**Studies show:**
- Upright posture reduces negative affect
- Slouching increases negative self-talk
- Posture affects hormone levels
- Body position influences emotions

**The mechanism:**
- Body feeds back to brain
- Posture signals emotional state
- Brain reads body cues
- Creates feedback loop

## Posture and Stress Response

**Upright posture:**
- Lower cortisol (stress hormone)
- Higher testosterone (confidence)
- Better stress tolerance
- More resilience

**Slouched posture:**
- Higher stress response
- Lower confidence
- More fearful thinking
- Reduced resilience

## Practical Application

**When anxious:**
- Stand or sit tall
- Open chest
- Shoulders back
- Deep breathing (easier in good posture)
- Hold for 2+ minutes

**Daily habits:**
- Regular posture checks
- Movement throughout day
- Exercise (double benefit)
- Posture awareness practice

## Two-Way Street

Anxiety also causes poor posture (protective hunching). Breaking the cycle at either point helps.
