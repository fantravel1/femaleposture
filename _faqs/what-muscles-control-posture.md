# What Muscles Control Posture?

**Quick Answer:** The key posture muscles are your deep core (transverse abdominis, multifidus), back extensors, glutes, deep neck flexors, and shoulder stabilizers. These work together to hold you upright.

## The Core Foundation

**Deep Core:**
- Transverse abdominis (wraps around trunk)
- Multifidus (spine stabilizer)
- Pelvic floor (base support)
- Diaphragm (top of core)

**What they do:** Create stable cylinder supporting spine

## Back Muscles

**Erector Spinae:**
- Run along spine
- Hold you upright
- Extend spine

**Rhomboids & Mid-Trapezius:**
- Pull shoulder blades together
- Counter rounded shoulders

## Lower Body

**Glutes:**
- Support pelvis
- Control pelvic tilt
- Connect to core

**Hip Flexors:**
- When balanced, allow neutral pelvis
- When tight, tilt pelvis

## Neck & Shoulders

**Deep Neck Flexors:**
- Control head position
- Oppose forward head posture

**Lower Trapezius:**
- Pulls shoulders down
- Stabilizes shoulder blades

## How to Strengthen Them

**Core:** Planks, dead bugs, bird dogs
**Back:** Rows, reverse flys, supermans
**Glutes:** Bridges, squats, lunges
**Neck:** Chin tucks, holds
**Shoulders:** Wall angels, Y-T-W raises
