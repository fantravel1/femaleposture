# Does Posture Affect Blood Pressure Readings?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, posture affects blood pressure readings. Body position changes immediate readings—crossed legs can raise BP 2-8 points. For accurate readings, sit upright with feet flat and arm supported at heart level.

## Position Effects on BP

**How position affects readings:**
- Lying: Often lowest readings
- Sitting: Standard measurement position
- Standing: May increase slightly
- Crossed legs: Can raise BP 2-8 points

## For Accurate BP Readings

**Proper position:**
- Sit in chair with back support
- Feet flat on floor
- Arm at heart level
- Uncrossed legs
- Relaxed, not talking

## Common Positioning Mistakes

**Avoid:**
- Crossed legs during reading
- Unsupported arm
- Sitting on edge of chair
- Talking during measurement
- Taking reading immediately after moving

## Chronic Posture Effects

**Long-term considerations:**
- Poor posture may affect breathing
- Compressed vessels from slouching
- Reduced physical activity
- Stress from chronic discomfort

Use consistent positioning for accurate monitoring and tracking.
