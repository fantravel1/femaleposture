# What Is Flat Back Syndrome?

**Quick Answer:** Flat back syndrome occurs when the normal inward curve of the lower back is reduced or lost, causing the spine to flatten. This makes standing straight difficult and causes forward leaning and pain.

## Signs of Flat Back

**Characteristics:**
- Reduced lumbar curve
- Difficulty standing upright
- Forward lean when standing
- Hip and knee flexion to compensate
- Back pain and fatigue

## Common Causes

**Why it develops:**
- Degenerative disc disease
- Post-surgical complication
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- Compression fractures
- Posterior pelvic tilt
- Prolonged poor posture

## Problems It Causes

**Associated issues:**
- Chronic back pain
- Difficulty walking upright
- Muscle fatigue
- Balance problems
- Leg pain in some cases

## Treatment Approaches

**Conservative:**
- Physical therapy
- Core strengthening
- Extension exercises
- Pain management
- Postural training

## Key Exercises

- Lumbar extension exercises
- Cat-cow stretches
- Superman variations
- Hip flexor stretches
- McKenzie exercises

Early intervention prevents progression. See a specialist if you notice significant flattening.
