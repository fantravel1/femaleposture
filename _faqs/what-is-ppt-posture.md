# What Is Posterior Pelvic Tilt (PPT)?

**Quick Answer:** Posterior pelvic tilt occurs when the pelvis rotates backward, causing the lower back to flatten and the tailbone to tuck under. This reduces the normal lumbar curve and can cause specific problems.

## Signs of PPT

**How it looks:**
- Flat lower back
- Tailbone tucked under
- Butt appears flat
- Reduced lumbar curve
- May have slouched appearance

## Common Causes

**Why it develops:**
- Tight hamstrings
- Tight gluteal muscles
- Weak hip flexors
- Tight abdominals
- Prolonged slouched sitting

## Associated Problems

**May cause:**
- Lower back pain
- Disc issues
- Hip problems
- Balance difficulties
- Gait changes

## Treatment Approach

**What helps:**
- Stretch hamstrings and glutes
- Strengthen hip flexors
- Work on lumbar mobility
- Neutral pelvis exercises
- Postural awareness

## Key Exercises

**Helpful movements:**
- Hip flexor strengthening
- Lumbar extension exercises
- Hamstring stretches
- Pelvic tilting practice

Less common than anterior pelvic tilt, but equally important to address.
