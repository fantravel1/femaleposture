# What's the Best Sleeping Position for Back Pain?

**Quick Answer:** Side sleeping with a pillow between your knees or back sleeping with a pillow under your knees are best for back pain. Both positions maintain spinal alignment and reduce pressure.

## Best Positions

**Side sleeping:**
- Pillow between knees
- Keeps spine aligned
- Reduces hip/SI joint stress
- Good for most people
- Slightly curled position okay

**Back sleeping:**
- Pillow under knees
- Supports natural curve
- Distributes weight evenly
- Good for disc issues
- Flat pillow for head

## Worst Position

**Stomach sleeping:**
- Twists neck
- Arches lower back
- Compresses spine
- Avoid if possible
- If can't avoid: thin pillow under hips

## Mattress Matters

**For back pain:**
- Medium-firm often best
- Not too soft (sags)
- Not too hard (pressure points)
- Replace every 7-10 years
- Test before buying

## Additional Tips

- Consistent sleep schedule
- Get in/out of bed carefully
- Morning stretches
- Consider mattress topper
- Pillow height matches position

## When to Seek Help

If back pain disrupts sleep regularly despite position changes, see a healthcare provider. Pain that wakes you from sleep warrants evaluation.
