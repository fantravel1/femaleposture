# What's the Best Pillow for Neck Pain and Posture?

**Quick Answer:** The best pillow keeps your neck in neutral alignment with your spine. Side sleepers need thicker pillows to fill the shoulder-to-head gap. Back sleepers need thinner support. Stomach sleepers often do best with very thin or no pillow.

## By Sleep Position

**Side sleepers:**
- Need thickest pillow
- Fill shoulder-to-head gap
- Keep neck straight, not bent
- Consider contoured pillows

**Back sleepers:**
- Need thinner pillow
- Support neck curve
- Don't push head forward
- Cervical contour may help

**Stomach sleepers:**
- Very thin or no pillow
- Reduce neck rotation
- Consider changing positions

## Pillow Types

**Options to consider:**
- Memory foam: Molds to shape
- Contoured: Built-in neck support
- Down/feather: Adjustable
- Latex: Supportive, resilient
- Water-filled: Customizable

## Signs of Wrong Pillow

**Indicators:**
- Morning neck pain
- Stiffness that eases with day
- Numbness or tingling
- Constantly adjusting pillow
- Waking frequently

## Replacement Timing

Replace pillow every 1-2 years. Fold in half—if it doesn't spring back, it's worn out.
