# What Is the Best Sleeping Position for Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Back sleeping is best—spine stays neutral and aligned. Side sleeping is good with proper support. Stomach sleeping is worst because it forces neck rotation and back hyperextension.

## Back Sleeping (Best)

**Benefits:**
- Spine stays in neutral alignment
- Head, neck, spine aligned
- No rotation or twisting
- Weight evenly distributed

**How to optimize:**
- Thin pillow under head
- Pillow fills neck curve
- Optional pillow under knees
- Don't prop head too high

## Side Sleeping (Good)

**Benefits:**
- Can keep spine aligned
- Reduces snoring
- May help reflux
- Comfortable for many

**How to optimize:**
- Thicker pillow (fills shoulder gap)
- Pillow between knees
- Hug pillow to prevent shoulder rounding
- Alternate sides

## Stomach Sleeping (Worst)

**Problems:**
- Forces neck rotation
- Hyperextends lower back
- Held for hours nightly
- Creates/worsens posture problems

**If you must:**
- Very thin or no pillow
- Pillow under hips
- Try to transition to side

## Changing Positions

It takes 2-4 weeks to adapt to new sleep position. Use pillows strategically to train new habit.
