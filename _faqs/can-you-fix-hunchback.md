# Can You Fix a Hunchback (Kyphosis)?

**Quick Answer:** Postural kyphosis (from habit) can often be significantly improved with exercises and awareness. Structural kyphosis (from bone changes) is harder to reverse but can still be managed.

## Types of Kyphosis

**Postural Kyphosis:**
- From poor posture habits
- Spine is structurally normal
- Corrects when you stand straight
- Very improvable

**Structural Kyphosis:**
- Bone/disc changes present
- Scheuermann's disease
- Osteoporosis-related
- Age-related changes
- Needs medical management

## How to Improve Postural Kyphosis

**Daily exercises:**
- Thoracic extension stretches
- Upper back strengthening
- Chest stretches
- Shoulder blade exercises

**Habit changes:**
- Posture awareness
- Ergonomic setup
- Movement breaks
- Core strengthening

## Timeline for Improvement

- 2-4 weeks: Increased awareness
- 1-2 months: Noticeable improvement
- 3-6 months: Significant change
- Ongoing: Maintenance needed

## When to See a Doctor

- Pain is severe
- Kyphosis is worsening
- Numbness or weakness
- Breathing affected
- Appearance concern

Early intervention gives best results.
