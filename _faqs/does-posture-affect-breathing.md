# Does Posture Affect Breathing?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, significantly. Slouched posture can reduce lung capacity by up to 30%. Upright posture allows full diaphragm movement and optimal breathing.

## How Posture Affects Breathing

**When You Slouch:**
- Ribs can't expand fully
- Diaphragm is compressed
- Lungs have less room
- Breathing becomes shallow

**When Upright:**
- Ribs move freely
- Diaphragm has full range
- Lungs can fill completely
- Deep breaths possible

## The Numbers

**Research shows:**
- Slouching reduces lung capacity 20-30%
- Slumped sitting reduces oxygen intake
- Forward head position restricts airway
- Poor posture increases breathing effort

## Signs Posture Is Affecting Your Breathing

- Feeling short of breath when sitting
- Yawning frequently
- Fatigue despite rest
- Shallow breathing habit
- Need to take deep breaths often

## How to Breathe Better

**Posture fixes:**
- Sit/stand tall
- Open chest
- Shoulders back and down
- Head over shoulders

**Breathing practice:**
- Belly breathing exercises
- Rib expansion awareness
- Regular deep breath breaks

Good posture = easier breathing = better energy.
