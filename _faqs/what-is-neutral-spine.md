# What Is Neutral Spine?

**Quick Answer:** Neutral spine is the natural position where your spine maintains its three normal curves: inward at the neck, outward at the upper back, and inward at the lower back. It's not flat or excessively curved—it's balanced.

## The Three Curves

**Normal spinal curves:**
- Cervical (neck): slight inward curve
- Thoracic (upper back): slight outward curve
- Lumbar (lower back): slight inward curve

## Finding Your Neutral Spine

**How to feel it:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Flatten lower back to floor (posterior tilt)
3. Arch lower back fully (anterior tilt)
4. Find the middle—that's neutral
5. Should have small gap under lower back

## Why Neutral Matters

**Benefits:**
- Even load distribution
- Less disc stress
- Optimal muscle function
- Reduced injury risk
- Efficient movement

## When to Maintain Neutral

**Especially important:**
- Lifting weights
- Deadlifts and squats
- Carrying loads
- Prolonged sitting
- Standing for extended periods

## Common Mistakes

- Thinking flat back is neutral
- Over-arching (too much curve)
- Losing neutral under load
- Never finding or practicing it

Neutral spine varies slightly person to person. The goal is your optimal position, not a rigid standard.
