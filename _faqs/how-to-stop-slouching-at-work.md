# How Do I Stop Slouching at Work?

**Quick Answer:** Stop work slouching by optimizing your workstation ergonomics, setting hourly movement reminders, strengthening postural muscles, and using visual cues. The key is making good posture easier than slouching.

## Ergonomic Setup

**Essential adjustments:**
- Monitor at eye level
- Arms at 90 degrees to keyboard
- Feet flat on floor or footrest
- Back supported by chair
- Screen arm's length away

## Reminder Systems

**What works:**
- Phone timer every hour
- Posture app notifications
- Sticky note on monitor
- Calendar reminders
- Associate with tasks (check posture every email)

## Strengthening Exercises

**Do at your desk:**
- Shoulder blade squeezes
- Chin tucks
- Seated cat-cow
- Chest stretches in doorway
- Standing back extensions

## Environment Changes

**Make slouching harder:**
- Remove overly soft chairs
- Stand during calls
- Walk meetings when possible
- Alternate sitting/standing
- Different positions throughout day

## Realistic Approach

Perfect posture all day isn't possible or necessary. Aim for:
- Regular position changes
- Awareness without obsession
- Movement breaks
- Gradual improvement

Progress over perfection—small consistent changes beat intense short-term efforts.
