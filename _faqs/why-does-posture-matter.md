# Why Does Good Posture Matter?

**Quick Answer:** Good posture prevents neck and back pain, allows optimal breathing and organ function, projects confidence, and protects your spine from long-term wear. It affects both physical health and how others perceive you.

## Long-Term Impact

## The Balance

Good posture matters, but so does movement. No posture is meant to be held forever. The best posture is one that:
- Changes frequently
- Allows easy movement
- Feels sustainable
- Doesn't cause strain

Static "perfect" posture isn't the goal—dynamic, varied positioning is.
