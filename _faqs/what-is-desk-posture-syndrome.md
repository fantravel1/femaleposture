# What Is Desk Posture Syndrome?

**Quick Answer:** Desk posture syndrome is a term for the collection of postural problems that develop from prolonged sitting at a desk—including forward head, rounded shoulders, tight hip flexors, and weak glutes.

## Common Components

**Typical pattern:**
- Forward head posture
- Rounded shoulders
- Tight chest muscles
- Tight hip flexors
- Weak core and glutes
- Upper back stiffness

## Why It Happens

**Contributing factors:**
- 8+ hours sitting daily
- Poor workstation setup
- Minimal movement breaks
- Screen position too low
- Keyboard too high
- Years of repetition

## Symptoms

**What you experience:**
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Upper and lower back ache
- Headaches
- Hip tightness
- Fatigue
- Stiffness after sitting

## Prevention and Treatment

**Key strategies:**
- Ergonomic workstation setup
- Hourly movement breaks
- Stretching routine
- Strengthening exercises
- Consider sit-stand desk

## Daily Countermeasures

**Do throughout day:**
- Chin tucks at desk
- Shoulder blade squeezes
- Stand for calls

Prevention requires ongoing attention—one ergonomic fix doesn't solve years of habits.
