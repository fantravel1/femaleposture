# What Is Proper Posture for Reading?

**Quick Answer:** Good reading posture keeps your head in neutral position with reading material at or near eye level. This prevents the neck strain that comes from looking down at books or screens in your lap.

## Ideal Reading Position

**Key elements:**
- Material at eye level (or angled up)
- Head balanced, not jutting forward
- Back supported
- Shoulders relaxed
- Adequate lighting

## Book Reading Setup

**Good options:**
- Use a book stand on desk
- Prop book on pillows at angle
- Hold book up rather than looking down
- Use a reading pillow
- Recline with support

## E-Reader/Tablet Reading

**Better positions:**
- Tablet at eye level in stand
- Propped on pillow while reclined
- Avoid lap viewing with head down
- Use adjustable holder
- Take regular breaks

## Common Mistakes

**Avoid:**
- Book in lap, chin to chest
- Lying flat holding book overhead
- Reading in bed hunched forward
- Poor lighting causing leaning
- Long sessions without breaks

## Tips for Avid Readers

- Invest in book stand or holder
- Vary positions throughout reading session
- Use good lighting
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Stretch neck and shoulders regularly
