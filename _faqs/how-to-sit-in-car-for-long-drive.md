# How Should I Sit During a Long Car Trip?

**Quick Answer:** Set up proper seat position before driving, use lumbar support, keep shoulders relaxed, and take walking breaks every 1-2 hours. Move and stretch at every stop to prevent stiffness and pain.

## Seat Setup

**Before driving:**
- Seat close enough for slight knee bend
- Recline 100-110 degrees
- Lumbar support in lower back curve
- Headrest at ear level
- Mirrors adjusted for good posture

## During the Drive

**While driving:**
- Shoulders relaxed down
- Hands at 9 and 3
- Avoid gripping wheel tightly
- Alternate hand positions slightly
- Use cruise control when safe

## Essential Breaks

**Every 1-2 hours:**
- Stop and walk 5-10 minutes
- Stretch hip flexors
- Arch back gently
- Roll shoulders
- Walk around the car

## Helpful Products

**For long trips:**
- Lumbar support pillow
- Seat cushion
- Neck pillow for passenger
- Cruise control use
- Portable foot rest (passenger)

## Problem Prevention

- Don't carry wallet in back pocket
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid heavy meals before driving
- Wear comfortable clothing
- Share driving if possible

Prevention is key—back pain is harder to fix once it starts during a trip.
