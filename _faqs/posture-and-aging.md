**However:**
- Not all changes are inevitable
- Activity level matters significantly
- Much can be prevented or improved

### Why does my back round more as I age?

**Contributing factors:**
- Disc dehydration and compression
- Vertebral changes (possibly compression fractures)
- Muscle weakness
- Habit and lifestyle
- Gravity's cumulative effect

### Is height loss normal?

**To some extent:**
- Losing 1-2 inches over decades is common
- Disc compression is main cause
- Excessive loss may indicate bone problems
- Worth discussing with doctor if concerned

### What's "dowager's hump"?

**Hyperkyphosis of thoracic spine:**
- Excessive forward rounding
- Can result from compression fractures
