# How Can I Check My Own Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Use the wall test (stand against a wall and check gaps), take photos from side and front views, or look in a mirror. Check for level shoulders, even hips, and natural spinal curves without excessive rounding or arching.

## Wall Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with heels 2 inches from wall
2. Back and head against wall
3. Check gaps at neck and lower back
4. Should fit flat hand, not more
5. Note what's hard to keep flat

## Mirror Check

**Front view:**
- Level shoulders?
- Level hips?
- Head centered?
- Weight even on feet?
- Knees pointing forward?

**Side view:**
- Ear over shoulder?
- Shoulder over hip?
- Hip over knee?
- Excessive curves?
- Head forward?

## Photo Assessment

**For accuracy:**
- Have someone take photos
- Wear fitted clothing
- Front, back, and side views
- Stand naturally, don't pose
- Compare over time

## What to Look For

**Common issues:**
- Head forward of shoulders
- Rounded shoulders
- Excessive low back arch
- Uneven shoulders/hips
- One-sided lean

## Limitations

Self-assessment helps awareness but has limits. A professional can identify subtle issues and their causes. Consider evaluation if you have pain or significant asymmetry.
