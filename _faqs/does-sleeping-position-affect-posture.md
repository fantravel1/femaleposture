# Does Sleeping Position Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. You spend 6-9 hours in your sleep position nightly, so it significantly impacts your posture. Side and back sleeping are generally best for posture.

## How Sleep Position Affects Posture

**During Sleep:**
- Spine is held in one position for hours
- Muscles adapt to sustained positions
- Joints stiffen in sleep postures
- Habits reinforce daytime patterns

## Best Sleeping Positions for Posture

**1. Back Sleeping (Best)**
- Spine stays neutral
- Weight evenly distributed
- Use thin pillow under head
- Pillow under knees optional

**2. Side Sleeping (Good)**
- Keeps spine fairly aligned
- Pillow between knees helps
- Pillow should fill neck gap
- Avoid curling into fetal ball

**3. Stomach Sleeping (Worst)**
- Forces neck rotation
- Hyperextends lower back
- Strains spine for hours
- Try to transition away

## Pillow Matters

**For back sleepers:** Thin pillow, neck supported
**For side sleepers:** Thicker pillow, fills shoulder gap
**For neck pain:** Cervical pillow may help

Your mattress should keep spine neutral—not too soft, not too firm.
