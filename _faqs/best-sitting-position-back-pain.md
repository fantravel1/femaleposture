# What Is the Best Sitting Position for Back Pain?

**Quick Answer:** Sit with your hips pushed back, lumbar curve supported, feet flat on the floor, and knees level with or slightly below hips. Most importantly—don't stay in any position too long.

## The Ideal Setup

**Hips and Pelvis:**
- Hips pushed back in chair
- Slight forward tilt (not slouching back)
- Pelvis neutral, not tucked under

**Back:**
- Lower back supported
- Natural curve maintained
- Upper back relaxed, not rounded

**Feet and Legs:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Knees at 90° or slightly more
- Knees level with or below hips

**Arms:**
- Elbows at ~90°
- Forearms supported
- Shoulders relaxed

## Key Principles

**The best posture is your next posture:**
- Change positions frequently
- Stand up every 30 minutes
- Movement beats perfect stillness

**Support matters:**
- Lumbar roll or pillow
- Chair that fits your body
- Adjustable is better

## Quick Fixes

- Add lumbar support
- Raise or lower chair
- Use footrest if needed
- Set movement reminders

Perfect sitting doesn't exist—regular movement does.
