# Can Poor Posture Cause Knee Pain?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, poor posture can contribute to knee pain. Misalignment at the hips or spine changes how forces travel through your legs, creating abnormal stress on the knees and potentially causing pain.

## How Posture Affects Knees

**The chain reaction:**
- Pelvic tilt changes hip angle
- Hip angle affects femur position
- Femur position affects knee tracking
- Knee stress increases
- Pain develops

## Posture Issues That Affect Knees

**Common culprits:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Hip internal rotation
- Flat feet
- Weak gluteus medius
- Muscle imbalances

## Signs Posture Is Involved

**Indicators:**
- Knee pain without injury
- Pain with prolonged standing/walking
- One-sided knee pain
- Pain improves with posture correction
- Hip or back issues too

## What Helps

**Correction strategies:**
- Address pelvic alignment
- Strengthen hips and glutes
- Improve core stability
- Check foot alignment
- Gait analysis if needed

## When to Seek Help

**See a professional if:**
- Knee swelling or instability
- Pain persists despite exercise
- Difficulty walking
- Locking or catching sensation
- Severe or worsening pain

Knee pain often requires a whole-body approach, not just local treatment.
