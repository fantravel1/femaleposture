# Should I Sleep Without a Pillow?

**Quick Answer:** It depends on your sleep position. Stomach sleepers may benefit from no pillow. Back sleepers might use thin or no pillow. Side sleepers almost always need a pillow to maintain neck alignment.

## By Sleep Position

**Back sleepers:**
- Thin pillow or none possible
- Need support under neck curve
- Too-high pillow pushes head forward
- Experiment to find comfort

**Side sleepers:**
- Definitely need a pillow
- Must fill gap between head and mattress
- Thicker pillow required
- Keeps neck aligned with spine

**Stomach sleepers:**
- No pillow often best
- Reduces neck strain
- Consider thin pillow under pelvis
- This position not ideal regardless

## Benefits of No Pillow

**For appropriate sleepers:**
- More natural neck position
- Less morning stiffness
- Better spine alignment
- Reduced wrinkles (some claim)

## When to Keep Your Pillow

**You need support if:**
- Side sleeper
- Have neck pain without pillow
- Broad shoulders (need gap filled)
- Sleep on soft mattress

## How to Transition

If trying no pillow:
- Gradually reduce pillow height
- Give it 1-2 weeks
- Note any pain changes
- Return to pillow if problems persist
