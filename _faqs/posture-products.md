## Posture Corrector Questions

### Do posture correctors work?

- Muscles may weaken with dependency
- May be uncomfortable
- Usually not recommended as primary solution

**If you do use one:**
- Use briefly (30 min-1 hour)
- Don't rely on it

### Which type of posture corrector is best?

**Types available:**
- Figure-8 straps (shoulders)

## Seating Products
