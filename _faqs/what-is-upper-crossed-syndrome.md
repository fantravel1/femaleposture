# What Is Upper Crossed Syndrome?

**Quick Answer:** Upper crossed syndrome is a specific pattern of muscle imbalance: tight chest/neck muscles crossed with weak upper back/deep neck muscles, creating rounded shoulders and forward head posture.

## The Pattern

**Tight/Overactive:**
- Pectoralis major/minor (chest)
- Upper trapezius (top of shoulders)
- Levator scapulae (neck to shoulder blade)
- Suboccipitals (base of skull)

**Weak/Inhibited:**
- Deep neck flexors (front of neck)
- Lower trapezius (mid-back)
- Rhomboids (between shoulder blades)
- Serratus anterior (rib cage side)

## What It Looks Like

**Visual signs:**
- Shoulders rolled forward
- Head jutted forward
- Increased upper back curve
- Chin pokes forward
- Hunched appearance

## Causes

- Prolonged sitting/computer work
- Driving position
- Phone use
- Desk jobs
- Sedentary lifestyle

## Problems It Creates

- Neck and shoulder pain
- Headaches
- Limited shoulder mobility
- Breathing restriction
- Poor posture appearance

## How to Fix It

**Stretch:** Chest, upper traps, suboccipitals
**Strengthen:** Deep neck flexors, lower/mid traps, rhomboids
**Habit changes:** Ergonomics, movement breaks, posture awareness
