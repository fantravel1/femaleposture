# Can Posture Affect Digestion?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. Slouching compresses your abdominal organs, slows digestion, worsens acid reflux, and can contribute to bloating and constipation.

## How Posture Affects Digestion

**When You Slouch:**
- Stomach and intestines get compressed
- Less room for organs to function
- Reduced blood flow to digestive system
- Diaphragm can't help move food

**Specific Effects:**
- Slower gastric emptying
- Increased acid reflux
- More bloating after meals
- Constipation issues

## The Sitting-After-Eating Problem

**Slumped sitting after meals:**
- Compresses stomach
- Pushes acid toward esophagus
- Slows food movement
- Causes discomfort

## Better Posture for Digestion

**After eating:**
- Sit upright or stand
- Take a gentle walk
- Avoid slumping on couch
- Wait before reclining

**While eating:**
- Sit tall
- Don't hunch over plate
- Breathe between bites
- Take your time

**General:**

If you have chronic digestive issues, posture may be one contributing factor worth addressing.
