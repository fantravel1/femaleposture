# Can Posture Affect Your Singing Voice?

**Quick Answer:** Posture dramatically affects singing quality. Good posture enables full lung capacity, optimal breath support, and proper vocal cord function. Poor posture restricts airflow and creates vocal strain.

## Why Posture Matters for Singing

**Key factors:**
- Lung capacity for breath support
- Open throat and resonance
- Diaphragm function
- Core engagement
- Jaw and neck freedom

## Ideal Singing Posture

**Standing:**
- Feet hip-width apart
- Knees soft, not locked
- Pelvis neutral
- Spine tall and relaxed
- Shoulders down and back
- Chin parallel to floor
- Head balanced on spine

**Seated:**
- Sit forward on chair
- Feet flat on floor
- Spine upright (no slouching)
- Same upper body as standing

## Common Posture Mistakes

**What hurts singing:**
- Raised chin (strains vocal cords)
- Locked knees (reduces breath)
- Rounded shoulders
- Collapsed chest
- Forward head position
- Rigid, tense stance

## Quick Improvements

- Release jaw tension
- Drop shoulders from ears
- Think "crown up, shoulders down"
- Stand against wall briefly
- Breathe from diaphragm

Good singing posture feels tall, open, and relaxed—not rigid.
