# What Is a Dowager's Hump?

**Quick Answer:** A dowager's hump is an exaggerated forward curve of the upper back, creating a visible hump at the base of the neck. It can be postural (reversible) or structural (from bone changes like osteoporosis).

## Two Types

**Postural (Reversible):**
- From chronic forward head posture
- Fatty tissue accumulation
- Muscle and connective tissue changes
- Can be improved with exercise

**Structural:**
- Vertebral compression fractures
- Osteoporosis-related
- Bone shape changes
- Harder to reverse

## Causes

**Postural factors:**
- Years of forward head posture
- Computer/phone use
- Poor sitting habits
- Weak upper back muscles

**Medical factors:**
- Osteoporosis
- Compression fractures
- Scheuermann's kyphosis
- Cushing's syndrome

## Can It Be Fixed?

**Postural type:**
- Yes, with consistent work
- Exercises help significantly
- May take months
- Won't fully disappear but improves

**Structural type:**
- Less reversible
- Can prevent worsening
- Medical treatment may help
- Exercise still beneficial

## Prevention and Treatment

- Correct forward head posture
- Strengthen upper back
- Stretch chest and front neck
- Address osteoporosis if present
- Maintain weight
- See doctor for assessment
