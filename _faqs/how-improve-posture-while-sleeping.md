# How Can I Improve My Posture While Sleeping?

**Quick Answer:** Sleep on your back or side with proper pillow support, avoid stomach sleeping, and ensure your mattress keeps your spine neutral throughout the night.

## Back Sleeping (Best)

**Setup:**
- Thin to medium pillow under head
- Pillow should fill neck curve, not prop head up
- Optional: pillow under knees for lower back

**Benefits:**
- Spine stays neutral
- Weight distributed evenly
- Reduces acid reflux

## Side Sleeping (Good)

**Setup:**
- Thicker pillow to fill shoulder gap
- Pillow between knees for hip alignment
- Hug pillow to prevent shoulder rounding

**Tips:**
- Alternate sides
- Avoid curling into tight ball
- Keep spine straight, not curved

## Stomach Sleeping (Avoid)

**Problems:**
- Forces neck rotation for hours
- Hyperextends lower back
- Worst for posture

**If you can't stop:**
- Use very thin pillow or none
- Pillow under hips
- Work on transitioning to side

## Pillow Selection

**For back sleepers:** Thin, supportive, cervical pillow optional
**For side sleepers:** Thick enough to fill shoulder-to-ear gap
**All sleepers:** Replace every 1-2 years

## Mattress Matters

- Should keep spine neutral
- Not too soft (sags) or too hard (pressure points)
- Medium-firm works for most
