# Why Do I Slouch When I'm Tired?

**Quick Answer:** When you're tired, your postural muscles fatigue and your brain conserves energy by allowing you to slump into passive positions supported by ligaments and joints rather than active muscle work.

## The Science

**Muscle Fatigue:**
- Holding posture requires constant muscle work
- Tired muscles can't sustain contraction
- Body defaults to hanging on structures

**Energy Conservation:**
- Good posture is "expensive" energetically
- Tired brain prioritizes essential functions
- Posture becomes lower priority
- Slouching is easier

## What's Happening

**When upright:**
- Back muscles actively working
- Core engaged
- Constant energy expenditure

**When slouching:**
- Muscles relax
- Ligaments and joints bear load
- Less energy required
- But more strain on passive structures

## Why It Matters

**Short-term:** Normal, not harmful
**Long-term:** Repeated slouching creates habit and tightness

## What to Do

**Prevention:**
- Get adequate sleep
- Take breaks before exhausted
- Strengthen postural muscles
- Movement when tired > sitting still

**When tired:**
- Change positions frequently
- Stand if you must stay awake
- Lie down properly if possible
- Gentle movement helps energy

Strong postural muscles resist fatigue longer.
