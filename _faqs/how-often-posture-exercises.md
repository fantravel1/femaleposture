# How Often Should I Do Posture Exercises?

**Quick Answer:** Daily is ideal. Aim for 10-20 minutes of posture exercises every day, plus brief posture checks throughout the day. Consistency beats intensity.

## Recommended Frequency

**For Best Results:**
- **Daily:** 10-20 minutes of targeted exercises
- **Hourly:** Brief posture checks and resets
- **Every 30 min:** Movement breaks if sitting

**Minimum Effective:**
- 3-4 times per week can still help
- But daily practice accelerates change
- Habits form faster with daily repetition

## Sample Daily Routine

**Morning (5 min):**
- Cat-cow stretches
- Chin tucks
- Shoulder circles

**Throughout Day:**
- Hourly posture checks
- Movement breaks
- Desk stretches

**Evening (5-10 min):**
- Chest stretches
- Upper back strengthening
- Hip flexor stretches

## Why Daily Works Better

- Muscles need frequent stimulus
- Habits form through repetition
- Tightness returns quickly
- Awareness improves with practice
- Small daily doses add up

## More Isn't Always Better

- Quality over quantity
- Don't overdo stretching
- Strength work needs recovery
- Listen to your body
- Consistency trumps marathon sessions

10 focused minutes daily beats an hour once a week.
