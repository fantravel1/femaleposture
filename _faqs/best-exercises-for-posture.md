# What Are the Best Exercises for Posture?

**Quick Answer:** The best posture exercises combine stretching tight muscles (chest, hip flexors) with strengthening weak ones (upper back, core). Key exercises include chin tucks, chest stretches, rows, planks, and hip flexor stretches.

## Top Strengthening Exercises

**Upper back:**
- Rows (band, cable, dumbbell)
- Reverse flies
- Face pulls
- Shoulder blade squeezes

**Core:**
- Dead bugs
- Bird dogs
- Planks
- Pallof press

## Essential Stretches

**What to stretch:**
- Chest/doorway stretch
- Hip flexor lunge stretch
- Upper trapezius stretch
- Neck stretches (chin tucks)

## Sample Daily Routine

**10-15 minutes:**
1. Chin tucks (2 min)
2. Chest doorway stretch (1 min each side)
3. Hip flexor stretch (1 min each side)
4. Shoulder blade squeezes (2 min)
5. Dead bugs (2 min)
6. Plank (1 min total)

## Key Principles

**For best results:**
- Consistency over intensity
- Balance stretching and strengthening
- Target your specific issues
- Daily practice
- Gradual progression

## What Doesn't Work

- Only stretching
- Random exercises without targeting weak points
- Exercising but maintaining poor habits
- Inconsistent effort

Focus on exercises that address your specific postural issues, not generic routines.
