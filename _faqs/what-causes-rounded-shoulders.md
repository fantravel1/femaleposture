# What Causes Rounded Shoulders?

**Quick Answer:** Rounded shoulders develop from tight chest muscles, weak upper back muscles, and prolonged forward-oriented activities like computer work, phone use, and driving. The muscle imbalance gradually pulls shoulders forward.

## Main Causes

**Muscle imbalance:**
- Tight pectorals (chest)
- Tight anterior deltoids
- Weak rhomboids
- Weak mid/lower trapezius
- Weak serratus anterior

**Behavioral factors:**
- Computer/desk work
- Phone use
- Driving
- Carrying bags
- Sitting posture

## The Pattern

**How it develops:**
1. Spend hours in forward positions
2. Chest muscles shorten
3. Back muscles lengthen/weaken
4. Shoulders naturally roll forward
5. Position becomes "default"

## Who's at Risk

**Common in:**
- Office workers
- Students
- Gamers
- Anyone with desk job
- People who carry heavy bags

## How to Correct

**Multi-step approach:**
- Stretch chest daily
- Strengthen upper back
- Improve workstation setup
- Take regular breaks
- Practice shoulder blade squeezes

## Prevention

- Vary activities throughout day
- Strengthen back muscles proactively
- Ergonomic workspace
- Regular movement
- Posture awareness
