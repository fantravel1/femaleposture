# How Should I Sit While Driving for Good Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Sit with your bottom against the seat back, knees slightly bent with feet reaching pedals, and lumbar support touching your lower back. Keep shoulders relaxed and hands at 9 and 3 o'clock.

## Seat Position

**Correct setup:**
- Seat close enough to reach pedals with slight knee bend
- Seat height so hips are level with or slightly higher than knees
- Recline angle 100-110 degrees
- Lumbar support adjusted to lower back curve

## Common Mistakes

**Avoid:**
- Sitting too far from pedals (causes reaching)
- Seat too reclined (strains neck)
- Wallet in back pocket
- Tensed shoulders
- Gripping wheel too tightly

## Long Drive Tips

**For road trips:**
- Stop every 1-2 hours
- Walk and stretch at breaks
- Use cruise control when safe
- Lumbar roll if seat lacks support
- Adjust mirrors to discourage slouching

## Hand Position

**Optimal placement:**
- 9 and 3 o'clock (or 8 and 4)
- Reduces shoulder tension
- Better control
- Arms relaxed

## Headrest Position

- Middle of headrest at ear level
- Head naturally touches headrest
- Reduces whiplash risk
- Supports neck in neutral
