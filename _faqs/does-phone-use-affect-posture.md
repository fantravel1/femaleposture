# Does Phone Use Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, significantly. Looking down at phones puts up to 60 pounds of strain on your neck, rounds your shoulders, and creates chronic postural changes known as "text neck" or "tech neck."

## The Problem

**When using phone:**
- Head drops forward 45-60 degrees
- Neck bears 40-60 lbs (vs 10-12 normally)
- Shoulders round forward
- Upper back hunches
- Hours per day adds up

**Average use:** 2-4+ hours daily looking down

## What It Causes

**Short-term:**
- Neck pain and stiffness
- Shoulder tension
- Headaches
- Fatigue

**Long-term:**
- Forward head posture
- Rounded shoulders
- Text neck syndrome
- Disc and joint problems

## How to Reduce Impact

**Device habits:**
- Raise phone to eye level
- Use voice commands
- Reduce unnecessary use
- Set time limits

**Throughout day:**
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Stretch neck and shoulders
- Do chin tucks
- Roll shoulders back

**Exercises:**
- Strengthen upper back
- Stretch chest
- Daily posture routine

Prevention is easier than reversing text neck.
