# What Is Flat Back Syndrome?

**Quick Answer:** Flat back syndrome is when the normal inward curve of your lower back (lordosis) is reduced or absent, causing your spine to be too straight and making you lean forward with difficulty standing upright.

## Characteristics

**Appearance:**
- Very straight lower back
- No visible lumbar curve
- Forward leaning trunk
- Head forward to compensate
- Difficulty standing erect

**Feeling:**
- Need to bend knees to stand
- Fatigue standing upright
- Leaning on support surfaces
- Difficulty looking straight ahead

## Causes

**Common causes:**
- Post-surgical (spinal fusion)
- Disc degeneration
- Compression fractures
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- Aging changes
- Some postural patterns

## Why It's Problematic

- Requires more energy to stand
- Creates forward imbalance
- Stresses other spine areas
- Can cause pain
- Limits activities

## Treatment

**Conservative:**
- Physical therapy
- Stretching hip flexors
- Core strengthening
- Posture training

**If caused by tucked pelvis:**
- Learn to anteriorly tilt pelvis slightly
- Hip flexor and quad strengthening
- Lumbar extension exercises

Medical evaluation recommended for significant cases.
