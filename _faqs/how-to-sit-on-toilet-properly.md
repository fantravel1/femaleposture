# What's the Proper Way to Sit on the Toilet?

**Quick Answer:** The optimal toilet position is with knees higher than hips, feet on a stool, and a slight forward lean. This mimics a squatting position, which straightens the rectum and makes elimination easier and more complete.

## Why Standard Sitting Isn't Ideal

**The problem:**
- Standard toilets angle at 90 degrees
- Creates kink in rectum
- Puborectalis muscle doesn't relax
- Requires straining
- Incomplete elimination

## Optimal Position

**How to sit properly:**
- Feet on 6-8 inch stool
- Knees above hip level
- Lean forward slightly
- Elbows on knees
- Relax, don't strain

## Benefits of Better Position

**What improves:**
- Easier elimination
- Less straining
- More complete emptying
- Reduced hemorrhoid risk
- Faster bowel movements

## Tools That Help

**Popular options:**
- Squatty Potty
- Any footstool
- Stack of books
- Yoga blocks
- Small step stool

## Who Benefits Most

**Especially helpful for:**
- Those with constipation
- Hemorrhoid sufferers
- Anyone who strains
- IBS sufferers
- Pregnant women

This natural position is how humans eliminated for millennia before modern toilets.
