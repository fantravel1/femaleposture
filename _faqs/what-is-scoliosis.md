# What Is Scoliosis?

**Quick Answer:** Scoliosis is a lateral (side-to-side) curve of the spine. It can range from mild curves that cause no symptoms to significant curves requiring treatment. About 2-3% of people have some degree of scoliosis.

## Types of Scoliosis

**Idiopathic (most common):**
- Cause unknown
- Usually develops in adolescence
- More common and progresses more in girls
- 80% of scoliosis cases

**Congenital:**
- Present at birth
- Vertebral malformations

**Degenerative:**
- Develops with aging
- Due to disc/joint changes

**Functional:**
- Due to muscle imbalance or leg length
- Spine structurally normal
- Often correctable

## Signs

**Visual indicators:**
- Uneven shoulders
- Uneven waist
- Rib hump when bending forward
- Uneven hips
- Asymmetric back

## Treatment Options

**Mild curves:**
- Observation
- Exercise/PT
- Posture work

**Moderate curves (adolescent):**
- Bracing to prevent progression
- Physical therapy
- Monitoring

**Severe curves:**
- May require surgery
- Ongoing management

## Important Note

Scoliosis needs professional assessment. Early detection helps—especially in adolescents where curves can progress.
