# Can Posture Affect Your Voice?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. Good posture opens your airways, allows full diaphragm movement, and removes tension from your throat—all essential for a strong, clear voice. Singers and speakers know this well.

## How Posture Affects Voice

**Breathing:**
- Upright = full lung capacity
- Slouched = compressed diaphragm
- Breath supports voice
- Poor breath = weak voice

**Throat/Larynx:**
- Forward head = throat tension
- Tension = strained voice
- Aligned head = open throat
- Open throat = clear sound

## Posture for Best Voice

**Ideal alignment:**
- Head balanced over shoulders
- Chin level
- Chest open
- Shoulders relaxed back
- Ribs can expand

## Signs Posture Affects Your Voice

- Voice tires quickly
- Strained speaking
- Limited volume
- Throat tightness
- Better voice when standing tall

## For Singers and Speakers

**Before speaking:**
- Stand tall
- Open chest
- Relax shoulders
- Take deep breath
- Chin level

**During:**
- Maintain alignment
- Breathe from diaphragm
- Keep throat open
- Avoid head jutting forward

Voice professionals prioritize posture training.
