# What Is Swayback Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Swayback posture is when the hips push forward beyond the line of the ankles while the upper body leans backward to compensate. This creates an exaggerated S-curve in the spine and is different from hyperlordosis.

## How to Identify Swayback

**Characteristics:**
- Hips pushed forward
- Upper body leaning back
- Hanging on ligaments
- Flattened lower back (often)
- Long curve in upper back
- Passive standing posture

## Swayback vs Hyperlordosis

**Key differences:**
- Swayback: hips forward, may have flat or curved low back
- Hyperlordosis: excessive low back arch, pelvis tilted
- Swayback is positional; hyperlordosis is curve-based
- Different muscle patterns

## Causes

**Why it develops:**
- Standing with locked knees
- Leaning into one hip
- Weak core muscles
- Fatigue posture habit
- Lack of body awareness

## Problems From Swayback

**May cause:**
- Lower back pain
- Hip discomfort
- Poor balance
- Ligament stress
- Core weakness perpetuation

## Correction Approach

**What helps:**
- Core strengthening
- Hip flexor activation
- Postural awareness
- Standing with soft knees
- Weight balanced over feet

Focus on standing with hips stacked over ankles, not pushed forward.
