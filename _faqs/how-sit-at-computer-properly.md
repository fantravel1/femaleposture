# How Should I Sit at a Computer?

**Quick Answer:** Screen at eye level, arms at roughly 90°, feet flat on floor, lower back supported, and sitting back in your chair. Most importantly—take breaks and move every 30 minutes.

## The Setup

**Monitor:**
- Top of screen at eye level
- Arm's length away
- No neck bending up or down
- No tilting head for bifocals

**Keyboard/Mouse:**
- Elbows at ~90°
- Forearms parallel to floor
- Wrists neutral (not bent)
- Keyboard at negative tilt if possible

**Chair:**
- Feet flat on floor (or footrest)
- Knees at 90° or slightly more
- Hips pushed back in seat
- Lumbar support

## Body Position

**Sitting posture:**
- Sit back in chair
- Lower back supported
- Shoulders relaxed
- Head over shoulders
- Eyes looking straight at screen

## The Movement Rule

**Every 30 minutes:**
- Stand up
- Move for 1-2 minutes
- Reset position
- No position is good for hours

## Common Mistakes

- Screen too low
- Sitting on chair edge
- Feet dangling
- Hunching forward
- No lumbar support
- Never taking breaks
