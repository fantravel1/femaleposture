# What Is Thoracic Kyphosis?

**Quick Answer:** Thoracic kyphosis is the outward curve of the upper back (thoracic spine). Some curve is normal and healthy. Excessive kyphosis (hyperkyphosis) creates a hunched appearance and may cause pain.

## Normal vs Excessive

**Normal kyphosis:**
- 20-40 degree curve
- Natural and healthy
- Balances other spinal curves
- No symptoms

**Excessive kyphosis:**
- Over 40-50 degrees
- Visible hump or rounding
- May cause discomfort
- Can restrict breathing

## Types of Excessive Kyphosis

**Causes vary:**
- Postural: From poor habits
- Scheuermann's: Develops in adolescence
- Degenerative: Age-related
- Congenital: Present at birth
- Osteoporotic: From vertebral fractures

## Symptoms

**May experience:**
- Rounded upper back appearance
- Upper back stiffness
- Fatigue with upright posture
- Breathing restriction
- Back pain

## Treatment

**Depends on type and severity:**
- Exercise and stretching (postural)
- Physical therapy
- Bracing in adolescents
- Pain management
- Surgery (severe cases only)

Postural kyphosis responds well to exercise. Other types may need specialized treatment.
