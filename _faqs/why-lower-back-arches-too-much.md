# Why Does My Lower Back Arch Too Much?

**Quick Answer:** Excessive lower back arching (hyperlordosis) is usually caused by tight hip flexors pulling your pelvis forward, combined with weak abdominals and glutes that can't counteract this pull.

## The Muscle Imbalance

**Tight/Overactive:**
- Hip flexors (psoas, rectus femoris)
- Lower back muscles (erector spinae)

**Weak/Underactive:**
- Abdominals
- Glutes
- Hamstrings

## Common Causes

**Lifestyle factors:**
- Prolonged sitting (shortens hip flexors)
- Standing with belly forward
- High heel wearing
- Weak core from inactivity

**Other factors:**
- Pregnancy
- Abdominal weight gain
- Habit and posture patterns
- Genetics (some people naturally have more curve)

## Why It Matters

**Can lead to:**
- Lower back pain
- Hip pain
- Poor appearance
- Reduced athletic performance
- Spinal compression

## How to Fix It

**Stretch:**
- Hip flexors daily
- Lower back gently

**Strengthen:**
- Glutes (bridges, squats)
- Abdominals (planks, dead bugs)
- Hamstrings

**Postural awareness:**
- Tuck pelvis slightly
- Engage core
- Don't stick belly out
