# How Long Should I Stand at a Standing Desk?

**Quick Answer:** Aim to alternate between sitting and standing every 30-60 minutes. A common recommendation is the 3:1 ratio—30 minutes standing to 60 minutes sitting. Standing all day is not better than sitting all day.

## Recommended Patterns

**Common approaches:**
- 30 min stand / 60 min sit
- 20 min stand / 40 min sit
- Every 30 minutes switch
- Listen to your body
- Build up gradually

## Why Not Stand All Day

**Problems from prolonged standing:**
- Leg and foot fatigue
- Lower back pain
- Varicose veins
- Joint stress
- Reduced productivity

## Building Up

**For new users:**
- Start with 15-20 minute intervals
- Increase gradually over weeks
- Take sitting breaks when needed
- Use anti-fatigue mat
- Wear comfortable shoes

## Signs You're Standing Too Long

**Watch for:**
- Leg tiredness
- Shifting weight constantly
- Lower back ache
- Foot pain
- Decreased focus

## Optimal Setup

**For healthy use:**
- Easy transition mechanism
- Anti-fatigue mat
- Footrest option
- Proper monitor height both positions
- Timer reminders to switch

Movement matters most—the goal is variation, not standing vs sitting.
