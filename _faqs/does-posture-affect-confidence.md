# Does Posture Affect Confidence?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, significantly. Research shows that upright posture increases feelings of confidence and power, improves mood, and changes how others perceive you.

## The Science

**Studies Show:**
- Upright posture increases testosterone, decreases cortisol
- Slouching associated with lower mood
- Expansive postures increase feelings of power
- Posture affects memory for positive vs negative information

## How It Works

**Body-to-Mind Connection:**
- Your brain reads your body's signals
- Upright = brain interprets as confident
- Slouched = brain interprets as defeated
- Physical state affects mental state

**Social Perception:**
- Others read your posture unconsciously
- Upright perceived as more confident
- Slouched perceived as less capable
- First impressions affected

## Practical Application

**Before important events:**
- Stand tall for 2 minutes
- Shoulders back, chin up
- Take up space
- Breathe deeply

**Daily practice:**
- Posture checks throughout day
- Catch yourself slouching
- Reset to confident posture
- Build the habit

**The cycle:**
Better posture → Feel more confident → Act more confident → Better outcomes → Better posture

Stand tall, feel tall.
