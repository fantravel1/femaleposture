# How Often Should I Stretch for Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Stretch the muscles that affect your posture daily. Once daily is minimum; 2-3 short sessions throughout the day is ideal. Consistency matters more than duration.

## Recommended Frequency

**For posture benefits:**
- Daily stretching (minimum)
- 2-3 times per day (optimal)
- After sitting periods
- Before bed

**Each session:**
- 5-10 minutes sufficient
- Hold stretches 30-60 seconds
- No bouncing
- Breathe and relax into stretch

## Key Muscles to Stretch

**Daily priorities:**
- Chest (doorway stretch)
- Hip flexors (kneeling lunge)
- Neck (side bends, chin tucks)
- Upper traps (ear to shoulder)

**Also helpful:**
- Lower back
- Hamstrings
- Shoulders

## When to Stretch

**Best times:**
- Morning (after waking stiffness)
- After sitting (prevents tightening)
- Before bed (relaxation)
- After exercise (when warm)

**Avoid:**
- Cold muscles (warm up first)
- Painful stretching
- Rushing through stretches

## Sample Daily Schedule

**Morning:** 3-5 min full routine
**Midday:** 2-3 min desk stretches
**Evening:** 5-10 min relaxing stretches

Short, frequent stretching beats occasional long sessions.
