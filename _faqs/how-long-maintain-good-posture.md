# How Long Should I Maintain Good Posture?

**Quick Answer:** The goal isn't to hold perfect posture forever. Change positions every 20-30 minutes. The best posture is your next posture—movement and variety matter more than maintaining any single position.

## The Wrong Approach

**Don't:**
- Try to hold perfect posture for hours
- Stay rigidly in one position
- Never relax your posture
- Beat yourself up for moving

## The Right Approach

**Do:**
- Change positions frequently
- Stand up every 30 minutes
- Move throughout the day
- Use good posture as your base
- Allow comfortable variation

## Movement Beats Stillness

**Why:**
- Static positions cause strain
- Muscles fatigue in any position
- Circulation needs movement
- No position is perfect forever

## Practical Guidelines

**Sitting:**
- Adjust every 20-30 minutes
- Stand up every 30-60 minutes
- Walk around when possible

**Standing:**
- Shift weight regularly
- Take sitting breaks
- Move and walk

**The 30-30-30 Rule:**
- 30 seconds to correct posture
- 30 minutes in each position max
- 30 steps or more each break

## Building Endurance

- Posture muscles strengthen over time
- Good posture becomes easier
- Less conscious effort needed
- But movement still essential
