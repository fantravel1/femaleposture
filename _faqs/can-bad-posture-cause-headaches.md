# Can Bad Posture Cause Headaches?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. Poor posture, especially forward head posture, can cause tension headaches by straining neck muscles that refer pain to the head.

## How Posture Causes Headaches

**The Mechanism:**
- Forward head position strains neck muscles
- Suboccipital muscles at skull base become tight
- Tension refers pain up and over the head
- Can trigger tension-type headaches

**Common Patterns:**
- Pain starts at base of skull
- Travels up and over head
- Often feels like a band around head
- Usually both sides affected

## Postures That Trigger Headaches

1. **Forward head posture** - head jutting forward of shoulders
2. **Looking down at phone** - "text neck"
3. **Computer slouching** - hunching at desk
4. **Sleeping position** - poor neck support

## How to Stop Posture-Related Headaches

**Immediate relief:**
- Chin tucks
- Neck stretches
- Heat on tight muscles

**Long-term prevention:**
- Screen at eye level
- Regular movement breaks
- Strengthen neck muscles
- Check pillow height

If headaches persist despite posture improvements, consult a healthcare provider.
