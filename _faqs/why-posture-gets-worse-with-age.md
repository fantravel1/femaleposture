# Why Does Posture Get Worse With Age?

**Quick Answer:** Age-related posture changes come from disc height loss, muscle mass decline, bone density reduction, joint stiffness, and accumulated poor habits over decades.

## Age-Related Changes

**Spine:**
- Intervertebral discs lose height
- Vertebrae may wedge (especially with osteoporosis)
- Natural curves may increase
- Less shock absorption

**Muscles:**
- Sarcopenia (muscle loss)
- Less strength to maintain posture
- Fatigue easier
- Slower recovery

**Bones:**
- Osteoporosis (reduced density)
- Compression fractures possible
- Structural changes

**Joints:**
- Cartilage wears
- Stiffness increases
- Range of motion decreases

## Lifestyle Accumulation

**Decades of:**
- Poor posture habits
- Sedentary time
- Repetitive positions
- Gravity's effect

## What Helps

**Prevention/improvement:**
- Regular strength training
- Flexibility maintenance
- Posture awareness
- Weight-bearing exercise
- Calcium/vitamin D
- Stay active

**It's not inevitable:**
- Active older adults maintain posture
- Exercise slows decline
- Improvement possible at any age
- Never too late to start
