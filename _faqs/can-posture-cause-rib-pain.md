# Can Poor Posture Cause Rib Pain?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, poor posture can cause rib pain. Slouching restricts rib movement, strains the muscles between ribs, and can cause dysfunction in the joints where ribs connect to the spine.

## How Posture Causes Rib Pain

**Mechanisms:**
- Restricted rib expansion from slouching
- Strained intercostal muscles
- Costotransverse joint dysfunction
- Altered breathing patterns
- Muscle tension in upper back

## Common Patterns

**Posture issues that cause rib pain:**
- Chronic slouching
- Forward head position
- Rounded upper back
- Shallow breathing habits
- Prolonged sitting

## Symptoms

**What you may experience:**
- Pain with deep breathing
- Aching between shoulder blades
- Sharp pain with certain movements
- Tenderness in rib area
- Clicking or popping sensations

## What Helps

**Treatment approach:**
- Improve sitting posture
- Thoracic spine mobility exercises
- Deep breathing practice
- Stretching intercostal muscles
- Upper back strengthening

## When to See a Doctor

**Seek help if:**
- Severe or sudden pain
- Pain with fever
- Difficulty breathing
- Pain radiating to arm
- No improvement with posture work

Most posture-related rib pain responds to correction and mobility work.
