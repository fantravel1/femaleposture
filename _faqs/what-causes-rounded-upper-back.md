# What Causes a Rounded Upper Back?

**Quick Answer:** Rounded upper back (thoracic kyphosis) is caused by weak upper back muscles, tight chest muscles, prolonged forward-leaning activities, poor posture habits, and in some cases structural changes.

## Postural Causes

**Muscle imbalances:**
- Weak rhomboids and mid-traps
- Tight pectoralis muscles
- Weak thoracic extensors
- Poor core support

**Daily habits:**
- Computer slouching
- Phone looking down
- Driving position
- All activities in front of body

## Structural Causes

**Physical changes:**
- Scheuermann's disease (adolescent)
- Osteoporotic compression fractures
- Disc degeneration
- Congenital differences

## Who Gets It

**Risk factors:**
- Desk workers
- Elderly (especially with osteoporosis)
- Adolescent growth spurts
- Inactive individuals
- Heavy breast tissue

## Reversibility

**Postural kyphosis:**
- Usually reversible
- Exercises help significantly
- Habit change needed
- Improvement possible at any age

**Structural kyphosis:**
- Harder to reverse
- Can improve or stabilize
- May need medical management

## Prevention & Treatment

- Strengthen upper back
- Stretch chest
- Posture awareness
- Regular movement
- Thoracic extension exercises
