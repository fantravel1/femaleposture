# Can Poor Posture Cause Eye Strain?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, poor posture contributes to eye strain. Slouching often means leaning closer to screens or positioning monitors incorrectly, both of which strain the eyes. The 20-20-20 rule helps.

## The Connection

**How posture affects eyes:**
- Slouching moves you closer to screen
- Poor monitor height causes squinting
- Forward head creates poor viewing angle
- Neck tension may affect blood flow
- Lighting often wrong with poor position

## Eye Strain Symptoms

**Signs to watch:**
- Tired eyes
- Headaches
- Blurred vision
- Dry eyes
- Neck and shoulder pain together

## Optimal Screen Setup

**For eye health:**
- Screen arm's length away
- Top of screen at eye level
- Reduce screen glare
- Proper lighting
- Upright posture

## The 20-20-20 Rule

**Every 20 minutes:**
- Look at something 20 feet away
- For 20 seconds
- Blink fully
- Then return to work

## Complete Approach

- Fix posture first
- Adjust screen position
- Check room lighting
- Take regular breaks
- Consider blue light glasses if helpful

Eye strain and posture problems often occur together—fix both for best results.
