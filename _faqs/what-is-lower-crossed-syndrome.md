# What Is Lower Crossed Syndrome?

**Quick Answer:** Lower crossed syndrome is a pattern of muscle imbalance in the lower body: tight hip flexors and lower back crossed with weak glutes and abdominals, causing excessive lower back arch and forward-tilted pelvis.

## The Pattern

**Tight/Overactive:**
- Hip flexors (psoas, iliacus)
- Rectus femoris (quad)
- Erector spinae (lower back)
- TFL (outer hip)

**Weak/Inhibited:**
- Gluteus maximus (butt)
- Abdominals (especially deep core)
- Hamstrings

## What It Looks Like

**Visual signs:**
- Excessive lower back curve
- Belly sticks forward
- Butt sticks out
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Belt tilts down in front

## Causes

- Prolonged sitting
- Lack of glute exercises
- Weak core training
- Standing with belly forward
- Sedentary lifestyle

## Problems It Creates

- Lower back pain
- Hip pain
- Reduced athletic performance
- Poor appearance
- SI joint issues

## How to Fix It

**Stretch:** Hip flexors, lower back, quads
**Strengthen:** Glutes, abs, hamstrings
**Awareness:** Neutral pelvis positioning
**Movement:** Reduce sitting, add walking/movement
