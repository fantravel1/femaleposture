# What Is Dowager's Hump (Kyphosis)?

**Quick Answer:** Dowager's hump is an excessive curve in the upper back (thoracic kyphosis) with a forward head position, creating a visible hump at the base of the neck. It can result from osteoporosis, poor posture, or both.

## Causes

**Why it develops:**
- Osteoporosis (vertebral compression)
- Chronic forward head posture
- Prolonged slouching
- Weak upper back muscles
- Aging-related changes

## Signs and Symptoms

**What you notice:**
- Visible hump at neck base
- Head positioned forward
- Rounded upper back
- Neck pain
- Upper back stiffness
- Difficulty looking up

## Prevention

**Reduce risk by:**
- Maintaining good posture
- Weight-bearing exercise
- Calcium and vitamin D intake
- Upper back strengthening
- Regular movement
- Bone density screening

## Can It Be Reversed?

**Depends on cause:**
- Postural: Often significant improvement possible
- Osteoporotic: Focus on preventing progression
- Combination: Partial improvement likely

Early intervention offers better outcomes. See a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
