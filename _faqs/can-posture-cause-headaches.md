# Can Poor Posture Cause Headaches?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, poor posture—especially forward head posture—is a common cause of tension headaches and cervicogenic headaches. The strain on neck and shoulder muscles from slouching can trigger head pain.

## Types of Posture-Related Headaches

**Tension headaches:**
- Band-like pressure around head
- Tightness in neck and shoulders
- Dull, aching pain
- Often worsens through the day

**Cervicogenic headaches:**
- Start in neck, radiate to head
- Usually one-sided
- Triggered by neck movement
- Often with neck stiffness

## Why Posture Causes Headaches

**The mechanism:**
- Forward head strains neck muscles
- Tight upper trapezius muscles
- Compressed cervical spine joints
- Muscle tension radiates to skull
- Trigger points develop

## Posture Fixes for Headaches

**What helps:**
- Correct forward head position
- Regular neck stretches
- Upper back strengthening
- Workstation ergonomics
- Movement breaks hourly

## When to See a Doctor

**Red flags:**
- Sudden severe headache
- Headaches with vision changes
- Fever with headache
- Headaches after injury
- Worsening despite treatment

Most posture-related headaches improve with posture correction and targeted exercises within a few weeks.
