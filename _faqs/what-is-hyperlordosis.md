# What Is Hyperlordosis (Excessive Lower Back Curve)?

**Quick Answer:** Hyperlordosis is an exaggerated inward curve of the lower spine (lumbar region), sometimes called swayback. It causes the pelvis to tilt forward, belly to protrude, and often leads to lower back pain.

## Signs of Hyperlordosis

**How it looks:**
- Large gap between lower back and wall
- Pelvis tilted forward
- Buttocks sticking out
- Belly protruding forward
- "Donald Duck" posture

## Common Causes

**Why it develops:**
- Tight hip flexors
- Weak abdominals
- Weak glutes
- Prolonged sitting
- Excess abdominal weight
- Pregnancy (temporary)
- Poor postural habits

## Associated Problems

**May cause:**
- Lower back pain
- Hip tightness
- Hamstring tension
- Disc compression
- Sciatic symptoms

## Treatment Approach

**Correction strategies:**
- Hip flexor stretching
- Core strengthening
- Glute strengthening
- Posterior pelvic tilt exercises
- Postural awareness

## Key Exercises

- Hip flexor lunge stretches
- Dead bugs
- Bird dogs
- Glute bridges
- Planks

Consistent work typically shows improvement in 4-8 weeks. Severe cases may need professional guidance.
