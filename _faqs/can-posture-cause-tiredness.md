# Can Bad Posture Cause Tiredness?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, poor posture causes fatigue in multiple ways: muscles work overtime to compensate, shallow breathing reduces oxygen, and your body spends energy fighting gravity inefficiently.

## How Posture Causes Tiredness

**The mechanisms:**
- Muscles strain to hold you up
- Compressed breathing reduces O2
- Poor circulation from compression
- Energy diverted to compensation
- Mental fatigue from discomfort

## Muscle Fatigue

**What happens:**
- Wrong muscles overworking
- Constant low-level tension
- No rest for postural muscles
- Trigger points develop
- Chronic tightness

## Breathing Impact

**Shallow breathing effects:**
- Less oxygen per breath
- Brain gets less oxygen
- Cells produce less energy
- General fatigue feeling
- Afternoon energy crashes

## Signs Your Posture Causes Fatigue

**Indicators:**
- Tiredness worse after sitting
- Energy improves with movement
- Fatigue in neck/shoulders
- Feel better after stretching
- Morning stiffness improves energy

## Solutions

**To increase energy:**
- Regular posture breaks
- Stretching throughout day
- Strengthen postural muscles
- Deep breathing exercises
- Ergonomic workstation

Fixing posture often provides unexpected energy boosts as your body works more efficiently.
