# How Does Pregnancy Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Pregnancy significantly affects posture. Growing belly shifts center of gravity forward, hormones loosen ligaments, and the body compensates with increased lower back curve, shoulder rounding, and forward head position.

## Common Changes

**During pregnancy:**
- Increased lumbar lordosis (sway back)
- Anterior pelvic tilt increases
- Shoulders may round forward
- Head moves forward
- Wide-based stance develops

## Why It Happens

**Contributing factors:**
- Growing uterus weight (forward)
- Center of gravity shift
- Relaxin hormone (loosens ligaments)
- Breast size increases
- Abdominal muscles stretch

## Common Problems

- Lower back pain (very common)
- Pelvic girdle pain
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Balance challenges
- Fatigue

## What Helps

**During pregnancy:**
- Gentle core exercises (if cleared)
- Pelvic floor work
- Walking
- Pregnancy-specific exercises
- Supportive shoes

**Posture tips:**
- Don't over-arch lower back
- Tuck pelvis slightly
- Keep shoulders back
- Sit with support
- Side sleeping with pillow

## After Pregnancy

Posture can return to normal, but may need:
- Core rehabilitation
- Diastasis recti care
- Postural exercises
- Time for recovery

Address posture early postpartum for best results.
