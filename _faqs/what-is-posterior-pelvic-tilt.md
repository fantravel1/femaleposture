# What Is Posterior Pelvic Tilt?

**Quick Answer:** Posterior pelvic tilt is when your pelvis rotates backward (tucking under), flattening the natural curve of your lower back. It's the opposite of anterior pelvic tilt.

## How to Identify It

**Signs:**
- Flat or reduced lower back curve
- Tucked-under butt appearance
- May slouch when sitting
- Belt line tilts up in front

**The Water Bucket Test:**
Imagine your pelvis as a bucket. With posterior tilt, water would spill out the back.

## Causes

**Muscle Imbalances:**
- Tight hamstrings
- Tight glutes
- Tight abdominals
- Weak hip flexors
- Weak lower back

**Lifestyle:**
- Prolonged slouched sitting
- Over-tucking during exercise
- Over-emphasis on ab exercises
- Weak core leading to tucking

## Problems It Can Cause

- Lower back pain (disc-related)
- Reduced shock absorption
- Hip pain
- Altered walking gait
- Less efficient movement

## How to Fix It

**Stretch:**
- Hamstrings
- Glutes

**Strengthen:**
- Lower back extensors
- Hip flexors
- Work on neutral pelvis awareness

**Posture cues:**
- Allow natural lower back curve
- Don't over-tuck pelvis
- Find neutral position
