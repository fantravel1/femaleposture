# What Is Military Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Military posture (attention stance) is an exaggerated upright position with shoulders pulled back, chest pushed out, and chin up. While it looks disciplined, it's too rigid for everyday use and can actually cause muscle strain.

## Military Posture Characteristics

**The stance:**
- Heels together
- Shoulders pulled far back
- Chest thrust forward
- Chin raised
- Back very straight
- Stomach sucked in

## Why It's Not Ideal

**Problems with this posture:**
- Too much lower back arch
- Excessive muscle tension
- Unsustainable long-term
- Can cause back pain
- Forces unnatural alignment

## Good Posture vs Military Posture

**Healthy posture is:**
- Relaxed but aligned
- Natural spinal curves
- Sustainable all day
- Shoulders down and back (not forced)
- Chin neutral (not raised)

## The Balance

**What to aim for:**
- Between slouching and military
- Tall but not rigid
- Engaged but not tense
- Maintainable without effort
- Comfortable and natural

## When Military Posture Fits

- Brief formal occasions
- Ceremonies
- Photos
- Not for daily use

Think "tall and relaxed" rather than "at attention" for everyday posture.
