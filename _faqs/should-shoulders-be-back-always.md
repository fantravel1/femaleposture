# Should My Shoulders Always Be Pulled Back?

**Quick Answer:** No, forcefully pulling shoulders back creates tension and isn't sustainable. Good shoulder position is relaxed—shoulders down away from ears and naturally slightly back, not pinched together or forced.

## Common Misconception

**The myth:**
- Shoulders must be squeezed back
- Constant tension required
- Military-style positioning
- Active holding all day

**The reality:**
- Shoulders should be relaxed
- Natural, not forced
- Down more than back
- Sustainable without effort

## Ideal Shoulder Position

**What to aim for:**
- Shoulder blades flat on rib cage
- Collarbones slightly open
- Shoulders down from ears
- Natural, not pinched together
- Able to breathe freely

## Why Forced "Back" Doesn't Work

**Problems:**
- Creates muscle fatigue
- Not sustainable
- Can cause back pain
- Leads to overcompensation
- Often overcorrects

## Better Approach

Instead of "pull back," think:
- Let shoulders drop down
- Open across chest naturally
- Think "wide collarbones"
- Release tension, don't add it
- Allow natural position

The goal is balance and ease, not forced positioning.
