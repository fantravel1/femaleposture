# Does Sitting Cause Tight Hip Flexors?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. When you sit, hip flexors are in a shortened position. Hours of daily sitting causes them to adaptively shorten, becoming tight and pulling on your pelvis, affecting posture.

## Why It Happens

**When sitting:**
- Hips flexed to 90 degrees
- Hip flexors in shortened position
- 8+ hours daily common
- Muscles adapt to held position
- Become genuinely shorter

## The Problem Muscles

**Primary hip flexors:**
- Psoas major (spine to thigh)
- Iliacus (pelvis to thigh)
- Rectus femoris (quad, crosses hip)

## What Tight Hip Flexors Cause

**Posture effects:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Excessive lower back curve
- Lower back pain
- Hip pain
- Affected gait

**Other effects:**
- Inhibited glutes
- Altered walking
- Limited hip extension
- Athletic performance loss

## How to Fix It

**Stretches:**
- Kneeling hip flexor stretch (daily)
- Couch stretch
- Pigeon pose variations
- Standing hip flexor stretch

**Movement:**
- Stand up frequently
- Walk more
- Hip extension exercises
- Glute activation work

**Key:** Can't just stretch—must reduce sitting and strengthen glutes too.
