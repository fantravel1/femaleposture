# Why Do My Shoulders Round Forward?

**Quick Answer:** Your shoulders round forward because of tight chest muscles pulling them forward, weak upper back muscles that can't counteract, and habitual forward-reaching positions (computer work, phone use, driving).

## The Muscle Imbalance

**Tight/Shortened:**
- Pectoralis major and minor (chest)
- Front deltoids
- Serratus anterior

**Weak/Lengthened:**
- Rhomboids
- Middle and lower trapezius
- Rear deltoids

## Why This Happens

**Modern Life Causes It:**
- Hours hunched over screens
- Driving position
- Cooking, reading, texting
- Everything we do is in front of us

**Cycle of Worsening:**
1. Position becomes comfortable
2. Muscles adapt to shortened/lengthened state
3. Position becomes default
4. More difficult to correct

## How to Fix It

**Stretch the front:**
- Doorway chest stretches
- Foam rolling chest
- Front shoulder stretches

**Strengthen the back:**
- Rows and pull-aparts
- Reverse flys
- Face pulls

**Change habits:**
- Shoulders back reminders
- Posture checks
- Movement breaks
