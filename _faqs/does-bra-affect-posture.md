# Does Your Bra Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. A poorly fitting bra can worsen posture by providing inadequate support or causing discomfort that leads to slouching. Proper support helps posture, especially for larger cup sizes.

## How Bras Affect Posture

**Poor Fit Effects:**
- Straps dig in, causing shoulder tension
- Back band rides up, less support
- Cups don't contain, forward lean
- Discomfort causes hunching

**Good Fit Benefits:**
- Weight properly distributed
- Shoulders relieved
- Spine can align naturally
- Comfort allows good posture

## Breast Size Matters

**Larger Breasts:**
- More weight to support
- Bra support more critical
- Poor support = forward pull
- Good bra = significant help

**Smaller Breasts:**
- Less weight impact
- Bra less critical for posture
- Comfort still matters

## Signs Your Bra Hurts Posture

- Straps constantly fall or dig in
- Red marks after wearing
- Back band rides up
- Hunching for comfort
- Neck and shoulder pain

## Proper Fit Elements

- Band provides 80% of support
- Straps shouldn't bear much weight
- Gore (center) lies flat
- Cups fully contain without spillage
- Comfortable for hours

## Best Bras for Posture

- Proper professional fitting
- Wide, cushioned straps
- Strong back band
- Consider posture bras for large busts
