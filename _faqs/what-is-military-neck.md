# What Is Military Neck (Cervical Kyphosis)?

**Quick Answer:** Military neck is when the natural forward curve of the neck (cervical lordosis) is reduced or reversed, making the neck abnormally straight or curved backward. Despite the name, it's not a healthy condition.

## Normal vs Military Neck

**Normal neck:**
- Gentle forward curve (lordosis)
- C-shaped when viewed from side
- Acts as shock absorber
- Distributes weight efficiently

**Military neck:**
- Straight neck (loss of curve)
- Or reversed curve (kyphosis)
- Named for rigid posture appearance
- Not actually good posture

## Symptoms

**May experience:**
- Neck pain and stiffness
- Headaches
- Radiating arm pain (sometimes)
- Limited neck mobility
- Muscle tension

## Causes

**Contributing factors:**
- Chronic forward head posture
- Whiplash or trauma
- Disc degeneration
- Muscle spasm holding neck straight
- Some genetic factors

## Treatment

**Conservative approaches:**
- Specific neck exercises
- Manual therapy
- Posture correction
- Heat/ice
- Gentle stretching

**Professional help:**
- Physical therapy
- Chiropractic care
- May need imaging

**Important:** Exercises for military neck differ from typical forward head exercises. Get proper assessment.
