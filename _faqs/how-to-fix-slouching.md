# How Do I Stop Slouching?

**Quick Answer:** Stop slouching through three approaches: build awareness (catch yourself), strengthen weak muscles (upper back), and stretch tight muscles (chest). Use reminders until good posture becomes habit.

## Immediate Fixes

**When you catch yourself:**
1. Sit or stand tall
2. Pull shoulders back
3. Engage core slightly
4. Chin level
5. Deep breath

## Build Awareness

**Reminders:**
- Phone alerts hourly
- Posture check apps
- Post-it notes at desk
- Watch that buzzes
- Link to activities (every email = check)

**The key:** You slouch unconsciously, so you need conscious triggers.

## Strengthen What's Weak

**Upper back exercises:**
- Rows
- Reverse flys
- Face pulls
- Band pull-aparts
- Wall angels

**Do these daily** to make good posture easier.

## Stretch What's Tight

**Release:**
- Chest doorway stretches
- Foam roll chest
- Neck stretches
- Hip flexor stretches

## Change Your Environment

- Screen at eye level
- Chair that supports
- Standing desk option
- Lumbar support

## The Timeline

**Breaking slouch habit:**
- Week 1: Constant reminders
- Week 2-4: Easier to remember
- Month 2+: Becoming natural
- Month 3+: New default forming
