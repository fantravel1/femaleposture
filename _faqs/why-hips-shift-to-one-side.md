# Why Do My Hips Shift to One Side?

**Quick Answer:** Hip shifting usually comes from standing on one leg habitually, muscle imbalances (especially hip abductors), leg length differences, or scoliosis compensations.

## Common Causes

**Habitual Patterns:**
- Standing with weight on one leg
- Leaning on counters/desks
- Crossing legs always same way
- Carrying items on one side

**Muscle Imbalances:**
- Weak hip abductors (side of hip)
- Tight QL (lower back/hip muscle)
- Asymmetric core strength
- Hip flexor differences

**Structural:**
- Leg length discrepancy
- Scoliosis
- Hip joint differences
- Pelvic bone asymmetry

## Effects

**Can cause:**
- Hip pain
- Lower back pain (on one side)
- Knee issues
- Altered gait
- Muscle strain

## How to Fix It

**Awareness:**
- Catch yourself shifting
- Stand on both feet equally
- Check mirror for alignment

**Exercise:**
- Strengthen hip abductors
- Single-leg balance work
- Core strengthening
- Hip stretches both sides

**If structural:**
- May need assessment
- Possible heel lift
- Physical therapy

Consistent awareness is key to changing habits.
