# Is Lying on the Floor Good for Your Back?

## How to Do It

**Best approach:**
- Lie on your back
- Knees bent, feet flat (or legs extended)
- Arms at sides or overhead
- Small pillow under head if needed
- 5-15 minutes

## Who It Helps

**Good for:**
- Those with tight lower backs
- After prolonged sitting
- Muscle tension relief
- Gentle stretching
- Resetting posture

## Who Should Avoid

**Not recommended if:**
- Severe disc issues
