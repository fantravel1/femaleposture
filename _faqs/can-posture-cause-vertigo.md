# Can Poor Posture Cause Dizziness or Vertigo?

**Quick Answer:** Poor posture can contribute to cervicogenic dizziness—a type of dizziness related to neck dysfunction. However, true vertigo (spinning sensation) usually has inner ear or neurological causes that need proper evaluation.

## Cervicogenic Dizziness

**Related to neck issues:**
- Dizziness with neck movement
- Associated with neck pain
- Often from posture problems
- May accompany headaches
- Usually not spinning sensation

## How Posture Contributes

**Possible mechanisms:**
- Neck muscle tension affects balance
- Altered proprioception from neck
- Compressed blood vessels (rare)
- Muscle tension and stiffness
- Forward head position

## True Vertigo vs Dizziness

**Differences:**
- Vertigo: Spinning or room moving
- Dizziness: Lightheadedness, unsteadiness
- Vertigo usually inner ear related
- Cervicogenic is more dizziness type

## When to See a Doctor

**Important to evaluate:**
- Spinning vertigo
- Sudden onset dizziness
- Hearing changes
- Vision problems
- Severe or persistent symptoms

## If Posture-Related

**What may help:**
- Neck posture correction
- Gentle neck exercises
- Physical therapy
- Address forward head position
- Reduce neck tension

Dizziness needs proper diagnosis—don't assume it's posture without evaluation.
