# Can Bras Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, bras can affect posture. A properly fitted, supportive bra can reduce forward pull on shoulders and upper back strain, especially for larger breasts. Poorly fitting bras can contribute to slouching and discomfort.

## How Bras Affect Posture

**The connection:**
- Breast weight creates forward pull
- Unsupported breasts cause slouching
- Shoulder strain from poor fit
- Band support reduces back strain
- Posture affects how bra fits

## Signs Your Bra Affects Posture

**Indicators:**
- Shoulder strap digging marks
- Back pain that improves braless
- Constant strap adjustment
- Forward shoulder pulling
- Relief with better fitting bra

## What Makes a Good Fit

**Key elements:**
- Band carries 80% of support
- Straps shouldn't dig in
- Band level, not riding up
- Cups contain all tissue
- Comfortable all day

## Who Benefits Most

**Particularly helpful for:**
- Larger bust sizes
- Those with back pain
- Athletes (sports bras)
- Long work days
- Physical work or exercise

## Professional Fitting

Consider professional bra fitting if you experience posture-related discomfort. Many women wear incorrect sizes that affect their comfort and posture.
