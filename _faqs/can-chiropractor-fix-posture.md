# Can a Chiropractor Fix Your Posture?

**Quick Answer:** A chiropractor can help improve posture through spinal adjustments, postural assessment, and exercise recommendations—but lasting change requires consistent effort on your part between visits.

## What Chiropractors Can Do

**Assessment:**
- Evaluate posture objectively
- Identify problem areas
- Find restrictions and imbalances

**Treatment:**
- Spinal adjustments
- Joint mobilization
- Soft tissue work
- Reduce restrictions

**Guidance:**
- Exercise prescription
- Ergonomic advice
- Postural awareness training
- Home care recommendations

## Limitations

**Adjustments alone:**
- Provide temporary relief
- Don't change muscle patterns
- Won't fix habits
- Need reinforcement

**Lasting change requires:**
- Your daily exercises
- Postural awareness
- Habit changes
- Consistent practice

## Best Approach

**Combination:**
- Professional care for issues you can't address alone
- Home exercises daily
- Postural awareness practice
- Lifestyle modifications

## When to See a Chiropractor

- Pain accompanying posture issues
- Restricted movement
- Not improving with exercises alone
- Want professional assessment
- Prefer manual therapy approach

Multiple visits usually needed—one adjustment won't fix years of postural patterns.
