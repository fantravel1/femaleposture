# What Is Sway Back Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Sway back posture is when your hips push forward past your shoulders while your upper back leans backward to compensate. It creates an exaggerated S-curve and is common in those who stand for long periods.

## How to Identify It

**Signs:**
- Hips thrust forward
- Chest leans back
- Long, flat lower back curve
- Rounded upper back
- Head forward
- "Lazy" appearance

**The Shape:**
Imagine standing with your pelvis pushed forward and upper body leaning back to balance.

## Causes

**Common factors:**
- Prolonged standing (a rest position)
- Weak core muscles
- Tight hamstrings
- Weak glutes
- Habit from fatigue

**Who gets it:**
- People who stand a lot
- Those with weak cores
- Teens (growth-related)
- Post-pregnancy

## Problems It Causes

- Lower back pain
- Hip joint stress
- Neck pain (from forward head)
- Poor appearance
- Muscle imbalances

## How to Fix It

**Strengthen:**
- Core (especially deep abs)
- Glutes
- Hip flexors (they're actually weak here)

**Stretch:**
- Hamstrings
- Chest

**Posture cues:**
- Hips back over ankles
- Stack ribs over pelvis
- Engage core
