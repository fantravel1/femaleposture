# What Causes Forward Head Posture?

- Phone and computer use
- Looking down at screens
- Driving position
- Poor workstation setup
- Heavy backpacks
- Sleeping with high pillow

## Muscle Imbalances

**What happens:**
- Tight: Suboccipitals, SCM, upper traps
- Weak: Deep neck flexors
- Shortened: Chest muscles
- Overstretched: Upper back muscles

## Why It Matters

**Problems caused:**
- Neck pain
- Headaches
- Shoulder tension
- Up to 60 lbs extra strain on neck
- Breathing restriction

## Risk Factors

**More likely if:**
- Desk job
- Heavy phone use
- Gaming
- Long driving
- Lack of exercise

## Prevention

- Screen at eye level
- Chin tucks throughout day
- Movement breaks
- Strengthen deep neck muscles
- Ergonomic setup

Forward head is correctable with consistent effort over 4-8 weeks.
