# Posture and Sleep FAQ

> **Rest and Recovery:** Sleep gives your body time to recover. Your sleep position and setup significantly affect how you feel upon waking and your posture throughout the day.

---

## Sleep Position Questions

### What's the best sleeping position for posture?

**Generally ranked:**
1. **Back sleeping:** Usually best for spine alignment
2. **Side sleeping:** Good with proper support
3. **Stomach sleeping:** Generally least recommended

**However:** The "best" position is one where you sleep well and wake without pain. Comfort matters.

### Why is stomach sleeping not recommended?

**Issues with stomach sleeping:**
- Neck rotated for hours
- Lower back often compressed
- Difficult to maintain neutral spine
- Can contribute to neck and back pain

**If you can't change:**
- Use very thin or no pillow
- Try pillow under hips
- Gradually transition to side

### How do I stop sleeping on my stomach?

**Strategies:**
- Place pillow blocking stomach position
- Wear something bulky on front
- Start on side with pillow support
- Be patient—habits take time to change
- It may take weeks

### Is side sleeping okay?

**Yes, with proper setup:**
- Pillow should fill neck-shoulder gap
- Pillow between knees helps alignment
- Avoid curling into tight fetal position
- Keep spine relatively neutral

### Which side should I sleep on?

**Generally:**
- Either side is fine for most people
- Left side may help with reflux
