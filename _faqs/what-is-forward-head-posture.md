# What Is Forward Head Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Forward head posture (FHP) is when your head positions itself in front of your shoulders rather than directly over them. For every inch forward, your head adds 10+ pounds of effective weight on your neck.

## How to Identify It

**Visual signs:**
- Head sits in front of shoulder line
- Chin juts forward
- Increased curve at base of skull
- Hump may develop at neck base
- Shoulders often rounded too

**The Wall Test:**
- Stand back against wall
- Can your head touch without straining?
- If not, you likely have FHP

## How Bad Is It?

**Effects of forward head:**
- Neck pain
- Headaches
- Shoulder tension
- Jaw problems
- Breathing restriction
- Fatigue

**The math:**
- Head weighs 10-12 lbs
- 1 inch forward = 20+ lbs force
- 2 inches forward = 30+ lbs force
- 3 inches forward = 40+ lbs force

## Common Causes

- Phone use (looking down)
- Computer work
- Reading
- Driving
- Poor sleeping position

## Can It Be Fixed?

Yes, with:
- Chin tuck exercises
- Upper back strengthening
- Chest stretching
- Posture awareness
- Screen height correction
