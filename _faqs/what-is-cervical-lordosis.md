# What Is Cervical Lordosis?

**Quick Answer:** Cervical lordosis is the normal C-shaped inward curve of your neck (cervical spine). A healthy neck has this curve. It can be reduced (straightened) or reversed by chronic forward head posture.

## Normal vs Abnormal

**Healthy lordosis:**
- Natural inward curve
- 20-40 degrees typical
- Supports head weight
- Allows normal movement

**Abnormal patterns:**
- Straightened (hypolordosis)
- Reversed (kyphotic)
- Excessive (hyperlordosis)

## Loss of Cervical Lordosis

**Causes:**
- Chronic forward head posture
- Phone and computer use
- Muscle imbalances
- Trauma or injury
- Degenerative changes

**Symptoms:**
- Neck pain
- Stiffness
- Headaches
- Reduced range of motion

## Can It Be Restored?

**Often improvable:**
- Postural correction
- Chin tuck exercises
- Neck strengthening
- Thoracic mobility work
- Ergonomic changes

## When to Seek Help

- Persistent neck pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Weakness in arms
- Significant x-ray findings
- Pain not improving

Many people restore healthier neck curves with consistent posture work.
