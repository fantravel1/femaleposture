# How Long Does It Take to Fix Rounded Shoulders?

**Quick Answer:** It typically takes 4-12 weeks of consistent daily exercises and posture awareness to see noticeable improvement in rounded shoulders. Complete correction can take 3-6 months.

## Timeline Breakdown

**Week 1-2:**
- Increased awareness of posture
- Muscles begin adapting
- May feel some soreness from new positions

**Week 3-4:**
- Improved muscle activation
- Easier to hold shoulders back
- Beginning of habit formation

**Week 5-8:**
- Visible postural improvements
- Shoulders naturally sit further back
- Less effort required to maintain position

**Week 9-12:**
- Significant improvement in most cases
- New posture becoming automatic
- Continued strengthening

## Factors That Affect Timeline

- **Severity:** Mild cases improve faster
- **Consistency:** Daily practice accelerates results
- **Age:** Younger people typically adapt faster
- **Underlying causes:** Addressing root causes speeds progress

## What You Need to Do Daily

1. Chest stretches (2-3 minutes)
2. Upper back strengthening (5-10 minutes)
3. Posture checks throughout day
4. Avoid prolonged hunching

Consistency matters more than perfection. Even 10 minutes daily creates change.
