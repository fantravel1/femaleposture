# How Can I Check My Own Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Use the wall test, mirror self-assessment, side-profile photos, or posture apps. Regular self-checks build awareness and help you track improvement.

## Wall Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with heels 2" from wall
2. Lean back so butt and shoulders touch
3. Can your head touch comfortably?
4. How much space behind lower back?

**Ideal:** Head touches without strain, 1-2 inch gap at lower back

## Mirror Check

**Front view:**
- Is head centered?
- Are shoulders level?
- Are hips level?
- Do arms hang evenly?

**Side view (use second mirror/photo):**
- Ear over shoulder?
- Shoulder over hip?
- Hip over ankle?
- Natural spinal curves?

## Photo Method

**Take side-profile photo:**
- Stand naturally (don't pose)
- Have someone photograph your side
- Draw vertical line from ear down
- Should pass through shoulder, hip, ankle

## Posture Apps

**Available tools:**
- Posture tracking apps
- AI analysis features
- Progress photos over time
- Reminder features

## Regular Checks

**Frequency:**
- Daily: Quick awareness checks
- Weekly: Mirror assessment
- Monthly: Progress photos
