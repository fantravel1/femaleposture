# Can Poor Posture Cause Shoulder Blade Pain?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, poor posture is a very common cause of shoulder blade pain. Forward head and rounded shoulders overstretch and weaken the muscles between your shoulder blades, causing aching and tension.

## Why Posture Causes Scapular Pain

**The mechanism:**
- Rhomboids and middle trap overstretched
- Muscles work overtime to stabilize
- Trigger points develop
- Chronic tension and aching
- Muscle fatigue

## Posture Patterns That Cause It

**Common culprits:**
- Forward head posture
- Rounded shoulders
- Upper crossed syndrome
- Prolonged computer use
- Phone use posture

## Symptoms

**What you feel:**
- Dull aching between shoulder blades
- Burning sensation
- Tightness in upper back
- Pain that worsens with sitting
- Tender spots (trigger points)

## Solutions

**What helps:**
- Correct forward head position
- Strengthen rhomboids and lower traps
- Stretch chest muscles
- Ergonomic workstation
- Regular movement breaks

## Key Exercises

- Rows (all types)
- Face pulls
- Prone Y's and T's
- Doorway chest stretch
- Chin tucks

Most shoulder blade pain from posture responds well to correction within a few weeks.
