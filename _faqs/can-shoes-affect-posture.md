# Can Shoes Affect Your Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, significantly. Your feet are the foundation of your posture. Shoe type, heel height, support level, and shoe condition all affect your alignment from the ground up.

## How Shoes Affect Posture

**High heels:**
- Shift center of gravity forward
- Increase lower back curve
- Tilt pelvis forward
- Change walking pattern
- Impact knees and hips

**Completely flat shoes:**
- May lack arch support
- Can cause overpronation
- Affect knee and hip alignment
- Not inherently bad, but consider individual needs

**Worn-out shoes:**
- Uneven support
- Altered gait
- Compensation patterns
- Can cause pain

## Best Shoes for Posture

**Features:**
- Low to moderate heel (0-2 inches)
- Good arch support for your foot type
- Wide toe box
- Secure fit
- In good condition

## Specific Considerations

**For standing work:** Supportive, cushioned
**For exercise:** Activity-appropriate, proper fit
**For dress:** Lower heel, comfortable width
**For daily wear:** Supportive, practical

## When Barefoot Is Good

- Strengthens foot muscles
- On safe, clean surfaces
- If feet are healthy
- As part of variety
