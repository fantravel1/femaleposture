# How Can I Improve My Child's Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Encourage regular movement and active play, set up proper homework stations, limit screen time with tech breaks, and model good posture yourself. Avoid nagging—make it fun and focus on strengthening through activity.

## Key Strategies

**What works:**
- Active play (climbing, sports, dance)
- Proper desk/table height
- Screen time limits
- Backpack weight under 10-15% body weight
- Parent modeling good posture

## Screen Time Setup

**For homework/devices:**
- Screen at eye level
- Feet touching floor or stool
- Back supported
- Regular breaks (every 20-30 min)
- Timer reminders

## Backpack Guidelines

**To protect spine:**
- Both straps always
- Weight under 15% of body weight
- Heaviest items close to back
- Padded straps
- Waist belt for heavy loads

## Red Flags

**See a doctor if:**
- Visible spinal curve
- Uneven shoulders/hips
- Pain with sitting or standing
- Refuses activities due to discomfort
- Posture dramatically worse than peers

## What Doesn't Work

- Constantly nagging
- Rigid posture rules
- Fear-based messaging
- Restricting all devices
- Expecting perfect posture

Focus on overall activity levels and make healthy habits normal, not special.
