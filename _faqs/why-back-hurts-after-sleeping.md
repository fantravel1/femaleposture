# Why Does My Back Hurt After Sleeping?

**Quick Answer:** Morning back pain typically comes from sleeping position, mattress quality, pillow height, or lack of nighttime movement. Your spine is compressed and stationary for hours, and poor positioning makes it worse.

## Common Causes

**Sleep Position:**
- Stomach sleeping (worst)
- Twisted positions
- Unsupported curves
- Same position all night

**Mattress Issues:**
- Too soft (sags, no support)
- Too firm (pressure points)
- Old/worn out
- Wrong for your body type

**Pillow Problems:**
- Wrong height for position
- Doesn't support neck properly
- Old and flat

**Other Factors:**
- Inflammatory conditions worse in AM
- Stiffness from immobility
- Disc rehydration overnight (taller, stiffer)

## Solutions

**Position:**
- Back or side sleeping
- Pillow between knees (side)
- Pillow under knees (back)
- Avoid stomach sleeping

**Equipment:**
- Medium-firm mattress for most
- Proper pillow height
- Replace every 7-10 years (mattress)

**Morning Routine:**
- Gentle stretches before rising
- Move slowly
- Cat-cow stretches
- Walk before sitting
