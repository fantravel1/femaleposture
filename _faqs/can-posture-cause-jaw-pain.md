# Can Bad Posture Cause Jaw Pain (TMJ)?

**Quick Answer:** Yes. Forward head posture changes the position of your jaw, strains the muscles that control it, and can contribute to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction and jaw pain.

## The Connection

**Forward head posture effects:**
- Changes jaw position (retracts mandible)
- Strains jaw muscles
- Alters how teeth come together
- Increases muscle tension
- Creates trigger points

## How It Happens

**When head moves forward:**
1. Jaw shifts back
2. Jaw-opening muscles tighten
3. Bite changes subtly
4. Extra stress on TMJ
5. Pain develops

## Common Symptoms

- Jaw clicking or popping
- Pain when chewing
- Headaches
- Ear pain
- Facial pain
- Neck pain (often together)

## The Muscle Link

**Key muscles affected:**
- Masseter (chewing)
- Temporalis (temple area)
- Pterygoids (inner jaw)
- Suboccipitals (base of skull)

## Fixing Posture-Related TMJ

**Posture work:**
- Correct forward head position
- Chin tucks
- Upper back strengthening
- Neck stretches

**Jaw-specific:**
- Jaw relaxation exercises
- Tongue position awareness
- Stress reduction
- Stop clenching/grinding

See a TMJ specialist if pain is significant.
