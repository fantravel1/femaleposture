# How Should I Sit With Sciatica?

**Quick Answer:** Sit with strong lumbar support, feet flat on floor, and avoid positions that worsen leg symptoms. Most importantly—don't sit for long periods. Movement is essential for sciatica.

## Best Sitting Positions

- Lower back well supported
- Natural lordotic curve maintained
- Feet flat on floor
- Knees at or below hip level
- Not slumped

**What helps:**

- Standing desk option

## Positions to Avoid

**Makes sciatica worse:**
- Slouching/slumping
- Sitting on wallet
- Crossing legs
- Low, soft seating
- Prolonged static sitting

## Movement Is Key

**Why:**
- Sitting compresses discs
- Movement promotes healing
- Circulation improves
- Muscles don't tighten

**Do:**
- Stand every 20-30 minutes
- Walk around
- Gentle stretches
- Change positions often

## Other Tips
