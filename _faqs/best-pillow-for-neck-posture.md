# What's the Best Pillow for Neck Posture?

**Quick Answer:** The best pillow keeps your neck aligned with your spine. Back sleepers need a thinner pillow that fills the neck curve, while side sleepers need a thicker pillow that fills the shoulder-to-ear gap.

## For Back Sleepers

**Ideal pillow:**
- Thinner profile
- Supports neck curve (not just head)
- Doesn't push head forward
- Cervical pillows with contour can help

**Test:** Lying down, ear should be level with shoulder

## For Side Sleepers

**Ideal pillow:**
- Thicker to fill shoulder gap
- Firm enough to stay lofted
- Keeps head level
- Consider pillow between knees too

**Test:** Head should not tilt up or down

## For Stomach Sleepers

**Recommended:**
- Very thin or no pillow
- But try to switch to side/back
- Worst position for neck

## Pillow Materials

**Memory foam:** Contours, good support
**Latex:** Responsive, maintains shape
**Down/feather:** Soft but may not support enough
**Buckwheat:** Adjustable, firm

## Signs Your Pillow Is Wrong

- Wake with neck pain
- Toss and turn
- Need arm under pillow
- Neck stiff in morning
- Pillow flat or lumpy

Replace pillows every 1-2 years.
