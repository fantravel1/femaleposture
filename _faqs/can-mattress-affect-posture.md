# Can Your Mattress Affect Posture?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, your mattress significantly affects spinal alignment during the 6-8 hours you sleep. A too-soft or too-firm mattress can cause poor sleeping posture, contributing to back pain and stiffness.

## How Mattress Affects Posture

**The connection:**
- Spine alignment during sleep
- 6-8 hours in same position
- Recovery time for muscles
- Morning stiffness patterns
- Chronic issues from poor support

## Signs Your Mattress Is Wrong

**Indicators:**
- Wake up stiff or achy
- Pain improves after moving around
- Visible sag in mattress
- Sleep better elsewhere
- Mattress over 7-10 years old

## Ideal Mattress Features

**What to look for:**
- Medium-firm for most people
- Supports natural spinal curves
- Doesn't sag with body weight
- Comfortable for your position
- Quality materials

## Sleep Position Matters

**Firmness by position:**
- Side sleepers: Slightly softer
- Back sleepers: Medium-firm
- Stomach sleepers: Firmer (but consider changing position)

## When to Replace

**Consider new mattress if:**
- Over 7-10 years old
- Visible sagging or wear
- Waking with pain regularly
- Better sleep on vacation
- Quality has declined

A good mattress is an investment in spinal health and daily comfort.
