# Why Is One Shoulder Higher Than the Other?

**Quick Answer:** Uneven shoulders are usually caused by muscle imbalances from one-sided activities, habitual postures, scoliosis, or a leg length difference. Most cases are postural and can be improved.

## Common Causes

**Muscle Imbalances:**
- Dominant side overuse
- One-sided sports
- Carrying bags on one shoulder
- Sleeping position

**Spinal Curvature:**
- Scoliosis (lateral spine curve)
- Compensatory curves
- Structural vs functional

**Leg Length Difference:**
- Pelvis tilts to compensate
- Spine curves above
- Shoulder height affected

**Habits:**
- Phone cradling
- One-sided computer setup
- Slouching one direction

## When It's Concerning

**See a professional if:**
- Significant difference
- Getting worse
- Pain present
- Other symptoms (numbness, weakness)
- Visible spinal curve

## What You Can Do

**For muscle imbalances:**
- Strengthen weak side
- Stretch tight side
- Balance activities
- Stop one-sided habits

**General:**
- Bilateral exercises
- Posture awareness
- Switch bags sides
- Ergonomic workstation

Some asymmetry is normal; perfect symmetry is rare.
