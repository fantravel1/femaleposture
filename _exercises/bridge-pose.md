# Bridge Pose (Setu Bandhasana)

> **A Posture Essential:** Bridge pose strengthens the muscles that support your spine while stretching the areas that get tight from sitting. It's one of the best poses for counteracting desk posture.

---

## Benefits for Posture

- **Strengthens glutes** — supports pelvis and lower back
- **Opens hip flexors** — counteracts sitting
- **Engages back muscles** — supports spinal extension
- **Stretches chest** — opens front body
- **Builds core stability** — creates foundation for alignment

---

## How to Do Bridge Pose

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back with knees bent
2. Feet flat on floor, hip-width apart
3. Arms alongside body, palms down
4. Feet close enough that fingertips can touch heels

### The Movement

1. **Press:** Push through your feet to lift hips off the floor
2. **Engage:** Squeeze glutes and engage core
3. **Lift:** Continue lifting until thighs are parallel to floor
4. **Align:** Keep knees hip-width (don't let them splay outward)
5. **Hold:** Maintain for 5-10 breaths
6. **Lower:** Slowly roll spine back down, one vertebra at a time

### Breathing

- **Inhale** to prepare
- **Exhale** as you lift
- **Breathe steadily** while holding
- **Exhale** as you lower

## Common Mistakes

### Knees Falling Outward
**Problem:** Reduces glute activation, stresses knees
**Fix:** Imagine squeezing a block between your knees

### Overarching Lower Back
**Problem:** Compresses lumbar spine
**Fix:** Engage core, tuck tailbone slightly, focus on glute squeeze

### Pushing Through Neck
**Problem:** Strains cervical spine
**Fix:** Keep back of neck long, chin slightly tucked

### Feet Too Far Away
**Problem:** Reduces glute engagement, overworks hamstrings
**Fix:** Position feet so fingertips just touch heels

## Modifications

### Easier: Supported Bridge
- Place a yoga block under sacrum
- Rest in supported position
- Great for gentle opening

### Easier: Smaller Range
- Lift hips just a few inches
- Build strength gradually
- Focus on form over height

### Harder: Single-Leg Bridge
- Extend one leg toward ceiling
- Keep hips level
- Increases glute demand

### Harder: Bridge March
- In bridge position, alternate lifting feet slightly
- Challenges stability
- Strengthens hip flexors

---

## Variations

### Dynamic Bridge
- Lift and lower with breath
- 10-15 repetitions
- Builds endurance

### Bridge with Block
- Place block between knees
- Squeeze throughout
- Increases adductor and glute activation

### Bridge Pulse
- Small pulses at top of movement
- 10-20 pulses
- Targets glute endurance

---

## For Specific Conditions

### For Anterior Pelvic Tilt
Bridge strengthens glutes and teaches posterior tilt. Focus on tucking tailbone and squeezing glutes at top.

### For Lower Back Pain
Start with smaller range of motion. Avoid overarching. Use supported bridge if needed.

### For Tight Hip Flexors
Hold at top for longer (30-60 seconds) to get a deeper stretch in front of hips.

### During Pregnancy
- Avoid lying flat on back after first trimester
- Use supported/elevated position if approved by provider

## When to Practice

- **Morning:** Wake up glutes, counteract sleep positions
- **Work breaks:** Reset after sitting
- **Before exercise:** Glute activation warm-up
- **Evening:** Release hip flexor tension from day

---

## Progression
