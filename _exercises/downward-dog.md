## Why Downward Dog Helps Posture

This pose addresses multiple posture-related issues:

**Lengthens the spine:**
Takes compression out of the back; creates space between vertebrae.

**Opens shoulders:**
Stretches the front of shoulders; counteracts rounded posture.

**Stretches hamstrings:**
Tight hamstrings contribute to pelvic tilt issues.

**Builds shoulder strength:**
Trains shoulders to stabilize in overhead position.

**Inverts the body:**
Reverses effects of standing/sitting all day.

## How to Do Downward Dog

### Starting Position

1. Start on hands and knees
2. Hands shoulder-width apart
3. Fingers spread wide, middle fingers pointing forward
4. Knees hip-width apart
5. Toes tucked under

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Press firmly into hands

**Step 2:** Lift knees off floor

**Step 3:** Lift hips up and back

**Step 4:** Begin to straighten legs (keep knees bent if needed)

**Step 5:** Press chest toward thighs

**Step 6:** Let head hang naturally between upper arms

**Step 7:** Reach heels toward floor (they don't need to touch)

**Step 8:** Hold for 5-10 breaths

### Key Points

- Arms are straight (elbows not locked, soft bend okay)
- Spine is long and straight (not rounded)
- Weight distributed between hands and feet
- Shoulders rotate externally (rotate upper arms outward)

---

## The Ideal Shape

### What to Aim For

Viewed from the side, the body forms an inverted V:
- Straight line from wrists through shoulders to hips
- Straight line from hips to heels (or bent knees)
- Head between upper arms, not hanging low
- Spine long and neutral

### What Often Happens Instead

- Rounded upper back (shoulders not open enough)
- Sinking into shoulders (not pressing floor away)
- Hyperextended lower back (trying too hard to straighten legs)
- Head pushing forward (not in line with arms)

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Stretch in back of legs (hamstrings, calves)
- Stretch in shoulders and chest
- Spine lengthening
- Arms and shoulders working
- Stretch along spine

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Wrist pain
- Sharp shoulder pain
- Dizziness or headache (prolonged inversion)
- Lower back pain

---

## Modifications for Different Bodies

### Tight Hamstrings

**The issue:** Legs can't straighten without rounding back

**Solution:**
- Bend knees generously
- Priority is straight spine, not straight legs
- Heels can be very far from floor
- "Puppy tilt" (bend knees, lift tailbone)

### Tight Shoulders

**The issue:** Can't get overhead position comfortably

**Solution:**
- Wider hand placement
- Bend elbows slightly
- Don't force shoulders open
- Progress gradually

### Wrist Sensitivity

**The issue:** Pressure on wrists is uncomfortable

**Solution:**
- Use wedge under heels of hands
- Make fists on floor instead
- Come onto forearms (dolphin pose)
- Reduce hold time

### Less Strength

**The issue:** Hard to hold the position

**Solution:**
- Shorter holds
- Come in and out multiple times
- Rest in child's pose between
- Build up over time

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rounding the Upper Back

**What happens:** Spine hunches, especially between shoulder blades
**Why it's wrong:** Loses spinal benefit; strains shoulders
**Fix:** Bend knees more; press chest toward thighs

### Mistake 2: Sinking Into Shoulders

**What happens:** Shoulders squeeze toward ears
**Why it's wrong:** Compresses shoulder joint; not sustainable
**Fix:** Press floor away; rotate upper arms outward

### Mistake 3: Hyperextending Lower Back

**What happens:** Lower back arches excessively
**Why it's wrong:** Compresses lumbar spine
**Fix:** Tuck tailbone slightly; engage core

### Mistake 4: Overstraightening Legs

**What happens:** Forcing straight legs at expense of spine
**Why it's wrong:** Rounds back; loses whole-body benefit
**Fix:** Keep knees bent until spine can stay long

### Mistake 5: Putting All Weight in Hands

**What happens:** 80%+ of weight on hands/wrists
**Why it's wrong:** Strains wrists; loses leg engagement
**Fix:** Press hips back; push weight into legs

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should my heels touch the ground?

Not necessarily. Heel position depends on hamstring flexibility, calf flexibility, and proportions. The goal is spine length, not heels on floor.

### Why do my wrists hurt in downward dog?

Common causes: too much weight forward, lack of hand engagement, wrist inflexibility. Try pressing into finger pads, using a wedge, or modifying to dolphin.

### How long should I hold it?

5-10 breaths is typical in a yoga flow. For stretching, 30-60 seconds works well. Listen to your body—rest when needed.

### Is down dog good for lower back pain?

For many, yes—it decompresses the spine. But if your back rounds or it hurts, bend knees more or skip it temporarily.

### Can I do downward dog if pregnant?

Generally yes, especially in early pregnancy. Later, you may need wider stance. Stop if uncomfortable. Some prefer puppy pose as belly grows.
