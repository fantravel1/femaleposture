3. Tuck chin toward chest
4. Draw belly button toward spine
5. Shoulder blades spread apart

- Stretch in back (cat)
- Loosening of stiffness
- Increased awareness

## Modifications

### Subtler Version

**For discrete practice:**
- Smaller range of motion
- Less obvious to others
- Still effective
- Good for open offices

### With Arms

**Added movement:**
- Cow: Arms open out to sides
- Cat: Arms cross in front
- Adds chest and shoulder mobility

### With Neck

**Include cervical spine:**
- Cow: Look up slightly
- Cat: Chin to chest
- More complete spinal movement

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Only Moving Shoulders

**Problem:** Missing the spinal movement
**Fix:** Feel the arch and round through your whole spine

### 2. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Limits benefit, adds tension
**Fix:** Coordinate breath with movement

### 3. Moving Too Fast

**Problem:** Misses the benefit
**Fix:** Slow, deliberate movement

### 4. Sitting Too Far Back

**Problem:** Chair back limits movement
**Fix:** Sit toward front edge of chair
