## Common Questions

### Will stretching at my desk really help?

Yes. Even short stretches help maintain mobility, reduce tension, and remind your body of good positions. It's not a replacement for larger movement breaks, but it's a valuable supplement.

### I forget to stretch. How can I remember?

Set phone alarms. Link stretches to triggers (after every meeting). Use reminder apps. Put a sticky note on your monitor.

### Is it unprofessional to stretch at work?

Basic stretches are generally accepted. Most people understand the need to move. If you're uncomfortable, do the subtle versions or step away briefly.

### What if I'm too sore to stretch?

Start gentler. A very stiff area needs movement but not aggressive stretching. Gentle motion is almost always better than no motion.
