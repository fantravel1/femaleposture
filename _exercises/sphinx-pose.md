## Modifications

### Easier Version

**Lower lift:**

- Less spinal extension
- Work at your level

**With pillow:**
- Pillow under chest

- Reduces intensity

### More Challenging

**Higher lift:**

- Increase extension
- Still keep pelvis down

**Longer holds:**
- Build up duration gradually
- 2-3 minutes

## Sphinx vs. Cobra

### Cobra Pose

- Deeper extension possible
- More challenging
- Shorter holds typically

**Start with sphinx, progress to cobra if appropriate.**

## Programming

### Daily Practice

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Elbows Too Far Forward

**Problem:** Less effective extension
**Fix:** Position elbows directly under shoulders

### 2. Shoulders by Ears

**Problem:** Creates neck tension
**Fix:** Draw shoulders down and back

### 3. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Limits benefit, creates tension
**Fix:** Breathe fully, expanding chest

### 4. Pushing Too Hard

**Problem:** Straining lower back
**Fix:** Find gentle, sustainable lift

### 5. Legs Too Tense

**Problem:** Unnecessary tension
**Fix:** Relax legs, let them rest
