## Why This Exercise Helps Posture

The serratus anterior:
- Holds shoulder blades flat against ribcage
- Prevents "winging" of shoulder blades
- Essential for overhead arm movement
- Works with other muscles for good posture
- Often weak in people with rounded shoulders

## Basic Scapular Push-Up

### Setup

1. Start in push-up position (hands under shoulders)
2. Arms straight
3. Body in straight line
4. Can modify on knees if needed

### The Movement

1. **Keep arms straight** throughout
2. Let shoulder blades squeeze together (sag between them)
3. Push through hands to spread shoulder blades apart
4. Feel the rounding of your upper back
5. Control back to start
6. Repeat 10-15 times

### Key Points

- Arms stay locked straight
- Movement only happens at shoulder blades
- Push the floor away at the top
- Control both directions

## What You Should Feel

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Bending Elbows

**Problem:** Turns into regular push-up
**Fix:** Lock elbows completely

### 2. Moving Too Fast

**Problem:** Misses the muscle activation
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movement

### 3. Not Enough Range

**Problem:** Barely moves shoulder blades
**Fix:** Full squeeze together, full spread apart

### 4. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Creates tension
**Fix:** Breathe throughout
