# Fire Hydrants: Hip Strengthening Exercise

> **At a Glance:** Fire hydrants (also called quadruped hip abduction) strengthen the gluteus medius and hip external rotators. The exercise targets hip stability muscles while challenging core control.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, hip external rotators |
| **Best For** | Hip stability, pelvic control, glute strengthening |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | Mat, resistance band (optional) |
| **Time** | 3 minutes |
| **Frequency** | Daily or 4-5 times per week |

## Why This Exercise Works

The gluteus medius:
- Stabilizes the pelvis during walking
- Controls hip movement
- Prevents knee collapse
- Supports lower back indirectly

Fire hydrants strengthen these muscles in a position that also:
- Challenges core stability
- Works hip external rotation
- Maintains neutral spine control

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Starting Position

1. Start on hands and knees (tabletop position)
2. Wrists under shoulders
3. Knees under hips
4. Spine neutral (natural curves)
5. Core gently engaged

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Keep your knee bent at 90 degrees throughout

**Step 2:** Keeping spine still, lift your right knee out to the side

**Step 3:** Lift until thigh is parallel to floor (or as high as possible with good form)

**Step 4:** Keep pelvis level—don't rotate or shift

**Step 5:** Hold briefly at top

**Step 6:** Lower with control

**Step 7:** Complete all reps, then switch sides

### Breathing

- Exhale as you lift
- Inhale as you lower
- Breathe continuously

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Work in outer hip and glute
- Core engaging to maintain stability
- Hip muscles fatiguing

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Pain in hip joint
- Lower back pain
- Cramping in hip flexors

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rotating the Pelvis

**What happens:** Hips rotate open toward lifted leg
**Why it's wrong:** Reduces glute engagement
**Fix:** Keep both hip bones pointing toward floor

### Mistake 2: Lifting Too High

**What happens:** Leg goes beyond parallel, body twists
**Why it's wrong:** Compensates with rotation
**Fix:** Only lift as high as you can maintain pelvis position

### Mistake 3: Arching Lower Back

**What happens:** Back sags, belly drops
**Why it's wrong:** Loses core engagement, may strain back
**Fix:** Keep core engaged, spine neutral

### Mistake 4: Moving Too Fast

**What happens:** Quick, jerky movements
**Why it's wrong:** Uses momentum instead of muscles
**Fix:** Slow and controlled—2 seconds up, 2 seconds down

## Variations

### Making It Harder

**With Resistance Band:**
1. Place loop band around thighs (above knees)
2. Perform movement against resistance
3. Significantly increases difficulty

**With Pulse:**
1. Lift to top position
2. Small pulses up
3. 10 pulses, then lower

**With Hold:**
1. Hold at top for 5-10 seconds
2. Then lower
3. Builds endurance

### Making It Easier

**Reduced Range:**
1. Smaller lift
2. Focus on keeping pelvis stable
3. Build range over time

## Programming

### For Beginners

- **Sets:** 2
- **Reps:** 12-15 each side
- **Frequency:** Daily

### For Strength

- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 15-20 each side
- **Add:** Resistance band
- **Frequency:** 4-5 times per week

### In a Routine

**Sample glute sequence:**
1. Clamshells (20 each side)
2. **Fire hydrants (15 each side)**
3. Glute bridges (15 reps)
4. Single-leg balance (30 sec each side)
