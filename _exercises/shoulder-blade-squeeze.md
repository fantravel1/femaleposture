# Shoulder Blade Squeezes: Simple Posture Activator

> **At a Glance:** One of the simplest exercises you can do for posture. Shoulder blade squeezes activate the muscles between your shoulder blades that keep your shoulders back. No equipment needed.

---

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Rhomboids, middle trapezius |
| **Best For** | Rounded shoulders, upper back weakness, desk workers |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | None |
| **Time** | 1-2 minutes |
| **Frequency** | Multiple times daily |

## Why This Exercise Matters

The muscles between your shoulder blades (rhomboids and middle traps) often become weak and lengthened from:
- Sitting at desks
- Phone use
- Driving
- Any forward-focused activity

Shoulder blade squeezes wake up these muscles and remind them what they're supposed to do: pull your shoulders back.

## How to Do Shoulder Blade Squeezes

### Starting Position

1. Sit or stand tall
2. Arms relaxed at sides
3. Shoulders in natural position (don't start by pulling back)
4. Core lightly engaged

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Keep shoulders down (away from ears)

**Step 2:** Squeeze shoulder blades together as if trying to hold a pencil between them

**Step 3:** Hold the squeeze for 5 seconds

**Step 4:** Release slowly

**Step 5:** Repeat 10-15 times

### Key Points

- Don't shrug shoulders up
- Think of moving blades back AND down
- Movement is small but intentional
- Breathe normally throughout

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Muscles between shoulder blades engaging
- Chest opening slightly
- Shoulders moving back
- Activation, not strain

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Neck pain
- Shoulder joint pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Sharp pain anywhere

## Variations

### With Arms

1. Extend arms forward at shoulder height
2. Pull elbows back, squeezing shoulder blades
3. Return arms forward
4. Repeat 10-15 times

### With Resistance Band

1. Hold band in front, arms extended
2. Pull band apart while squeezing shoulder blades
3. Control return
4. 10-15 reps

### Against Wall

1. Stand with back against wall
2. Arms at sides, elbows bent 90 degrees
3. Press backs of arms into wall while squeezing blades
4. Hold 5 seconds
5. Repeat 10 times

### Prone (Lying Face Down)

1. Lie face down, arms at sides
2. Lift chest slightly
3. Squeeze shoulder blades together
4. Hold 5 seconds
5. Lower
6. Repeat 10 times

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Shrugging Shoulders

**What happens:** Shoulders lift toward ears during squeeze
**Why it's wrong:** Uses upper traps instead of target muscles
**Fix:** Think "down and back" not "up and back"

### Mistake 2: Not Actually Squeezing

**What happens:** Moving shoulders back without blade engagement
**Why it's wrong:** Doesn't activate the right muscles
**Fix:** Imagine squeezing something between your blades

### Mistake 3: Arching Lower Back

**What happens:** Spine extends to create movement
**Why it's wrong:** Compensating; not targeting upper back
**Fix:** Keep core engaged; movement is only in upper back

### Mistake 4: Holding Breath

**What happens:** Breath stops during squeeze
**Why it's wrong:** Creates tension; reduces effectiveness
**Fix:** Breathe normally throughout

## Programming

- As warm-up before upper body work

### Posture Reset

When you catch yourself slouching:
1. Do 5-10 shoulder blade squeezes
2. Reset your posture
3. Continue with day

## Building on This Exercise

Once shoulder blade squeezes are easy, progress to:
- [Band Pull-Aparts](/exercises/band-pull-aparts/)
- [Rows](/exercises/rows/)
- [Face Pulls](/exercises/face-pulls/)
- [Prone Y-Raises](/exercises/prone-y-raises/)

These add resistance and work the same muscles harder.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do shoulder blade squeezes?

As often as you want. They're low-intensity and can be done many times throughout the day. More frequency = better posture awareness.

### Will this fix my rounded shoulders?

Shoulder blade squeezes are part of the solution. Combine with:
- Chest stretching
- Posture awareness
- Other upper back exercises

### I don't feel anything. Am I doing it wrong?

Possible reasons:
- Not squeezing hard enough
- Shrugging instead of retracting
- Upper back already fatigued

Try the prone version—it's easier to feel the muscle activation.

### Can I do this with shoulder problems?

Gentle shoulder blade squeezes are usually safe and often recommended. If they cause pain, stop and consult a professional.
