# Side Plank: Core Stability and Lateral Strength

> **At a Glance:** The side plank targets your obliques and lateral hip muscles—key stabilizers often neglected in core training. Essential for balanced core strength and pelvic stability.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Obliques, quadratus lumborum, gluteus medius |
| **Best For** | Core stability, hip stability, posture, scoliosis prevention |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Equipment** | None (mat optional) |
| **Time** | 3-5 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 3-4x per week |

## Why Side Planks Matter

Side planks address muscles that:
- Stabilize your pelvis when walking/standing
- Prevent hip drop during single-leg activities
- Support spine laterally
- Are often weak from sitting
- Help prevent and manage lower back pain

## How to Do a Side Plank

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your side
2. Place forearm on ground, elbow under shoulder
3. Stack feet on top of each other (or stagger for easier version)
4. Align body in straight line from head to feet

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Engage core

**Step 2:** Lift hips off ground

**Step 3:** Create straight line from head to feet

**Step 4:** Hold position

**Step 5:** Lower with control

**Step 6:** Switch sides

### Key Points

- Keep hips stacked (top hip directly over bottom)
- Don't let hips sag toward floor
- Don't pike hips up
- Shoulder stays over elbow
- Neck neutral (look straight ahead)

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Obliques (side of waist) working
- Hip of bottom leg engaging
- Core stabilizing
- Shoulder blade muscles activating

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Shoulder pain
- Lower back pain
- Neck strain
- Wrist pain (if on hand)

## Progressions

### Level 1: Knee Side Plank

**Easiest version:**
1. Lie on side
2. Bend bottom knee 90 degrees
3. Support on knee and forearm
4. Lift hips to form line from knee to shoulder
5. Hold 15-30 seconds

### Level 2: Forearm Side Plank (Standard)

As described above with straight legs.
- Hold 20-30 seconds
- Build to 45-60 seconds

### Level 3: Hand Side Plank

1. Support on hand instead of forearm
2. Arm straight
3. More demanding on shoulder
4. Hold 20-30 seconds

### Level 4: Side Plank with Hip Dip

1. Start in side plank
2. Lower hip toward floor (controlled)
3. Lift back to straight line
4. 10-12 reps each side

### Level 5: Side Plank with Leg Lift

1. Hold side plank
2. Lift top leg toward ceiling
3. Hold or pulse
4. Adds hip abductor work

### Level 6: Star Side Plank

1. On hand (straight arm)
2. Top leg lifted
3. Top arm reaching up
4. Most challenging balance

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Hips Sagging

**Problem:** Hips drop toward floor
**Fix:** Engage obliques and glutes more; use easier progression

### 2. Hips Piking Up

**Problem:** Hips pushed too high, bent at waist
**Fix:** Create straight line; drop hips slightly

### 3. Rolling Forward or Back

**Problem:** Not stacking body properly
**Fix:** Focus on keeping shoulders and hips stacked

### 4. Shoulder Creeping Up

**Problem:** Shoulder shrugs toward ear
**Fix:** Press shoulder blade down and back

### 5. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Not breathing during hold
**Fix:** Breathe continuously; avoid breath-holding

## Programming Side Planks

### Basic Core Routine

- 3 sets of 20-30 second holds
- Both sides (always even)
- Include with front plank

### Building Endurance

- Start with current max
- Add 5 seconds weekly
- Goal: 45-60 seconds per side

### Dynamic Approach

- Side plank hip dips: 3 × 10-12 each side
- More muscular endurance focus
- Good for those who dislike holding

### For Athletes

- Include leg lifts
- Progress to star plank
- Add unstable surfaces (advanced)

---

## Side Plank and Posture

### How It Helps

- Strengthens muscles that prevent hip drop in gait
- Supports spine laterally
- Balances left-right asymmetries
- Works with other core exercises for complete stability

### Asymmetry Check

Notice if one side is significantly weaker. If so:
- Extra set on weak side
- Or work weak side first when fresh
- Common to have imbalances

---

## Special Considerations

### For Lower Back Pain

Side planks are often well-tolerated:
- Less spinal compression than crunches
- Study-proven for back pain (McGill Big 3)
- Start with knee version

### For Shoulder Issues

May need modification:
- Use knee version for less shoulder demand
- Ensure elbow is under shoulder
- Skip if painful

### For Pregnancy

- Okay in early pregnancy for most
- Later pregnancy: monitor for diastasis
- Side-lying position safer than front planks
- Consult provider

## The McGill Big 3

Side planks are part of spine researcher Dr. Stuart McGill's recommended core exercises:

1. **Curl-Up** (modified crunch)
2. **Side Plank** (or side bridge)
3. **Bird-Dog**

This combination builds core stability while minimizing spinal stress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is one side so much weaker?

Very common. We all have asymmetries from:
- Dominant hand use
- Sleep positions
- Past injuries
- Habitual postures

Work both sides, perhaps extra on the weak side.

### How long should I hold a side plank?

- **Beginner:** 15-20 seconds
- **Intermediate:** 30-45 seconds
- **Advanced:** 60+ seconds

Quality matters more than duration. Stop when form breaks.

### Is side plank better than regular plank?

Neither is "better"—they target different muscles. Side planks work lateral core; regular planks work anterior core. Both are valuable.

### Can side planks help with back pain?

Often yes. Research supports side planks as part of back pain management. The lateral muscles they target are important for spinal stability.
