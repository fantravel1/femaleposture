## Common Mistakes

### 2. Twisting the Torso

**Problem:** Rotating body instead of isolating hip
**Fix:** Keep hips and shoulders facing forward

### 3. Leaning Away

**Problem:** Compensating for limited range
**Fix:** Stay upright, only go as far as you can with good form

### 4. Locked Standing Knee

**Problem:** Standing leg fully straight
**Fix:** Slight bend in standing knee

### 5. Starting Too Big

**Problem:** Full range from first swing
**Fix:** Build up range gradually
