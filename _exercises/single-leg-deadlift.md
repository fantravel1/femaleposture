## How to Do Single-Leg Deadlifts

### Starting Position

1. Stand on your right leg
2. Left foot lightly touching floor for balance (or hovering)
3. Arms at sides or hands on hips
4. Stand tall with core engaged

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Slightly bend standing knee (never locked)

**Step 2:** Hinge at hip, sending left leg straight back

**Step 3:** Lower torso toward floor as back leg rises

**Step 4:** Keep back flat—body forms a T from head to back foot

**Step 5:** Lower until you feel a stretch in standing leg hamstring (or parallel to floor)

**Step 6:** Squeeze glute of standing leg to return to standing

**Step 7:** Complete reps on one side, then switch

### Key Points

- Keep hips square (don't let hip of back leg rotate up)
- Maintain flat back throughout
- Back leg stays straight
- Move slowly with control
- It's okay to touch floor for balance

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Hamstring of standing leg stretching and working
- Glute of standing leg engaging
- Core working to stabilize
- Balance challenge

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Lower back pain
- Knee pain
- Sharp hip pain
- Loss of form with every rep

---

## Progressions

### Beginner: Wall Touch

1. Stand near wall
2. Fingertips touch wall for balance
3. Perform movement with support
4. Progress to less wall contact

### Beginner: Kickstand

1. Back foot stays on ground (on toe)
2. Most weight on front leg
3. Provides balance assist
4. Great for learning pattern

### Intermediate: Bodyweight

Full movement without support as described above.

### Advanced: Weighted

1. Hold dumbbell or kettlebell
2. In opposite hand from standing leg (or same hand, or both)
3. Adds load to strengthen further
4. Only progress when form is solid

### Advanced: Deficit

1. Stand on small platform
2. Increases range of motion
3. Greater stretch and strength demand

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rounding the Back

**What happens:** Spine curves during movement
**Why it's wrong:** Stresses lower back; loses muscle engagement
**Fix:** Only go as low as you can with flat back

### Mistake 2: Hips Opening Up

**What happens:** Hip of back leg rotates toward ceiling
**Why it's wrong:** Changes the movement; loses hip focus
**Fix:** Keep both hip bones pointing toward floor

### Mistake 3: Knee Caving In

**What happens:** Standing knee collapses inward
**Why it's wrong:** Stresses knee; indicates weak hips
**Fix:** Actively push knee out; strengthen hips

### Mistake 4: Going Too Fast

**What happens:** Rushing through movement
**Why it's wrong:** Loses balance benefit; uses momentum
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movement (3 seconds each direction)

### Mistake 5: Locking Standing Knee

**What happens:** Knee fully straight
**Why it's wrong:** Reduces muscle engagement; stresses joint
**Fix:** Maintain soft bend throughout

### For Balance Training

- 2-3 sets of 6-8 each leg
- Focus on control and stability
- Progress slowly

### For Posture

- 2-3 sets of 8-10 each leg
- 2-3 times per week
- Combine with other hip exercises

- Women focused on glute strength
- Anyone improving posture

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I lose balance?

Balance comes with practice. Start with wall support or kickstand version. Your proprioception (position sense) will improve over time.

### Should I use weight?

Only after you can do 10+ controlled reps with good form. Master bodyweight first.

### How low should I go?

Go until you feel your hamstring stretch or until your form starts to break. Most people stop around parallel to the floor.

### Is this the same as a Romanian deadlift?

Similar hip hinge pattern, but single-leg version adds balance challenge and addresses asymmetries.

### What if one side is weaker?

Common. Start with your weaker side when fresh. You may do extra reps on the weak side to build balance.
