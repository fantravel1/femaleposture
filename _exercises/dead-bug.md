# Dead Bug Exercise: Core Stability Without Back Strain

> **At a Glance:** Dead bug is one of the safest and most effective core exercises. It teaches your core to resist extension (arching) while moving your limbs—exactly what your core needs to do in daily life. Perfect for beginners, those with back pain, and postpartum recovery.

## Why This Exercise Works

Traditional ab exercises like crunches:
- Can strain the lower back
- May worsen diastasis recti
- Don't train core function

Dead bug trains your core to:
- Resist extension (keeping back flat)
- Stabilize while limbs move
- Work as a unit with breathing
- Protect the spine during movement

This is exactly what your core does in real life—stabilizes your trunk while arms and legs move.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back
2. Bend knees and lift feet off floor (tabletop position)
3. Knees over hips, shins parallel to floor
4. Raise arms straight up toward ceiling
5. Press lower back into the floor (eliminate the gap)
6. This position is your baseline—maintain it throughout

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Take a breath in to prepare

**Step 2:** As you exhale, slowly lower your right arm overhead (toward floor behind you)

**Step 3:** Simultaneously extend your left leg straight out (toward floor in front)

**Step 4:** Keep your lower back pressed into the floor—this is essential

**Step 5:** Only lower arm and leg as far as you can maintain back contact

**Step 6:** Inhale and return to starting position

**Step 7:** Repeat with left arm and right leg

**Step 8:** Alternate sides

### Breathing

- **Exhale:** As you extend arm and leg (this helps engage core)
- **Inhale:** As you return to start
- Never hold your breath
- The exhale is key to core activation

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Deep core muscles working
- Abs engaging to keep back flat
- Controlled, smooth movement
- Slight challenge to maintain position
- No strain in lower back

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Lower back arching off floor
- Lower back pain
- Neck strain
- Excessive fatigue leading to poor form

---

## The Key Point: Back Position

The entire benefit of dead bug depends on one thing: **keeping your lower back pressed into the floor**.

If your back arches:
- You've lost core engagement
- You're not getting the benefit
- You need to make the exercise easier

**How to know if you're doing it right:**
- Slide your hand under your lower back before starting
- There should be minimal to no gap
- If the gap increases during the movement, you've lost it

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Lower Back Arching

**What it looks like:** Gap develops between lower back and floor
**Why it's wrong:** Loses all core benefit; can strain back
**How to fix:** Don't lower limbs as far; focus on maintaining back position

### Mistake 2: Holding Breath

**What it looks like:** Face straining, not breathing
**Why it's wrong:** Increases intra-abdominal pressure; loses core coordination
**How to fix:** Exhale as you extend; breathe continuously

### Mistake 3: Moving Too Fast

**What it looks like:** Quick, uncontrolled movements
**Why it's wrong:** Uses momentum instead of control
**How to fix:** Take 3-4 seconds to lower, 3-4 seconds to return

### Mistake 4: Lowering Limbs to Floor

**What it looks like:** Arm and leg touching floor each rep
**Why it's wrong:** May be too much range; back often arches
**How to fix:** Only go as far as you can keep back flat

### Mistake 5: Head Lifting

**What it looks like:** Head and neck straining up
**Why it's wrong:** Not necessary; can strain neck
**How to fix:** Keep head relaxed on floor; can use small pillow

## Modifications and Variations

### Making It Easier

**Arms Only:**
1. Keep both feet on floor, knees bent
2. Only move arms
3. Great starting point

**Legs Only:**
1. Keep arms at sides or on belly
2. Only extend one leg at a time
3. Build up to full version

**Heel Slides:**
1. Keep feet on floor
2. Slide heel along floor to extend leg
3. Less load than lifting leg

**Reduced Range:**
1. Don't lower arm/leg as far
2. Stay in range where back stays flat
3. Gradually increase range

### Making It Harder

**Slow Tempo:**
1. 5 seconds to lower
2. 5 seconds to return
3. Significantly harder

**With Hold:**
1. Pause at extended position for 5-10 seconds
2. Breathe while holding
3. Builds endurance

**Band Resistance:**
1. Hold resistance band in hands
2. Loop around feet
3. Band creates resistance as you extend

**With Weight:**
1. Hold light weight in hands
2. Adds load to arm movement
3. Progress carefully

## Programming

### For Beginners / Postpartum

- **Sets:** 2
- **Reps:** 8-10 each side
- **Tempo:** Slow and controlled
- **Frequency:** Daily
- **Start with:** Arms only or heel slides if needed

### For Core Strength

- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 12-15 each side
- **Tempo:** Controlled with pauses
- **Frequency:** 4-5 times per week

### In a Routine

**Best paired with:**
- Glute bridges
- Bird dog
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Planks (as progression)

**Sample core sequence:**
1. Diaphragmatic breathing (10 breaths)
2. **Dead bug (10 each side)**
3. Bird dog (10 each side)
4. Glute bridge (15 reps)

## Special Considerations

### Postpartum

Dead bug is one of the first core exercises recommended postpartum:
- Safe for diastasis recti when done correctly
- Start with breath-focused version at 2-4 weeks
- Progress to arm or leg only
- Full version typically appropriate by 4-6 weeks
- Stop if any doming visible in abdomen

### With Diastasis Recti

Dead bug is generally safe and often recommended:
- Focus on exhale and deep core engagement
- Watch for doming along midline (if you see it, regress)
- Keep range small initially
- Progress slowly

### With Lower Back Pain

Often beneficial for lower back pain:
- Teaches core to protect spine
- Low-load, controlled movement
- Should not increase pain
- If painful, try easier version or consult PT

### During Pregnancy

Can be done into second trimester:
- Avoid lying flat on back for extended periods after first trimester
- May need to prop upper body on pillows
- Keep range of motion comfortable
- Listen to your body

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is it called dead bug?

Because of the position—arms and legs up in the air, like a dead bug on its back. Not glamorous, but accurate!

### How is dead bug different from bicycle crunches?

Dead bug is anti-extension focused (preventing back arching), while bicycle crunches involve spinal flexion and rotation. Dead bug is safer for backs and better for functional core training.

### Can I do dead bug every day?

Yes. It's a low-load exercise focused on motor control and endurance. Daily practice is beneficial, especially when building the skill.

### What if I can't keep my back flat?

Make the exercise easier: try arms only, legs only, or heel slides. Only progress when you can maintain back position throughout.
