> **At a Glance:** Band pull-aparts are one of the simplest yet most effective exercises for strengthening the muscles that hold your shoulders back. All you need is a resistance band.

---

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Rear deltoids, rhomboids, middle traps |
| **Best For** | Rounded shoulders, upper back weakness, posture correction |

## Why Band Pull-Aparts Help Posture

These muscles often become weak from:
- Sitting and desk work
- Phone use
- Driving
- Any forward-focused activity

When weak, they can't hold your shoulders back, leading to rounded shoulders. Band pull-aparts strengthen exactly what needs strengthening.

Benefits include:
- Strengthens shoulder retractors
- Improves shoulder blade stability
- Counteracts forward posture
- Warms up shoulders before workouts
- Easy to do anywhere

## The Basic Band Pull-Apart

### Starting Position

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold band with both hands, arms straight in front at chest height
3. Palms facing down
4. Hands about shoulder-width apart on band
5. Light tension in band (not slack)

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Keep arms straight (slight bend in elbows is okay)

**Step 2:** Pull hands apart, stretching the band

**Step 3:** Squeeze shoulder blades together as band reaches chest

**Step 4:** Pull until band touches chest (or close to it)

**Step 5:** Hold briefly at end position

**Step 6:** Return to start with control

**Step 7:** Repeat for prescribed reps

### Key Points

- Keep shoulders down (don't shrug)
- Core engaged, standing tall
- Don't arch back excessively
- Control the return (don't let band snap back)
- Focus on shoulder blade squeeze

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Muscles between shoulder blades working
- Rear shoulders engaging
- A "squeeze" at the end position
- Muscles fatiguing over reps

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Shoulder joint pain
- Neck pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Sharp pain anywhere

## Variations

### Overhand Pull-Apart (Palms Down)

The standard version described above. Works rear deltoids and rhomboids evenly.

### Underhand Pull-Apart (Palms Up)

1. Hold band with palms facing ceiling
2. Pull apart same as standard
3. Emphasizes lower traps
4. Good for those who shrug during standard version

### High Pull-Apart

1. Hold band overhead, arms forming a Y
2. Pull down and apart toward shoulders
3. Works different angle of upper back
4. More challenging for shoulders

### Low Pull-Apart

1. Hold band in front of hips
2. Arms angled slightly downward
3. Pull apart toward hips
4. Emphasizes lower traps

### Pull-Apart with External Rotation

1. Start with elbows bent 90 degrees, by your sides
2. Forearms pointing forward
3. Pull apart by rotating forearms outward
4. Elbows stay tucked
5. Excellent for rotator cuff

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Shrugging Shoulders

**What happens:** Shoulders rise toward ears during pull
**Why it's wrong:** Uses upper traps instead of target muscles
**Fix:** Actively pull shoulders down before and during movement

### Mistake 2: Using Momentum

**What happens:** Jerky, fast movements
**Why it's wrong:** Reduces muscle work; can stress joints
**Fix:** Slow, controlled pulls; 2-3 seconds each direction

### Mistake 3: Not Pulling Far Enough

**What happens:** Stopping before full retraction
**Why it's wrong:** Misses the most important part of the movement
**Fix:** Pull until band touches or nearly touches chest; squeeze

### Mistake 4: Choosing Wrong Resistance

**What happens:** Band too light or too heavy
**Why it's wrong:** Too light = not effective; too heavy = poor form
**Fix:** Should be challenging for 15-20 reps with good form

### Mistake 5: Arching Lower Back

**What happens:** Leaning back to complete the movement
**Why it's wrong:** Takes work away from upper back; stresses spine
**Fix:** Keep core engaged; stand tall

## Programming

### For Posture Correction

- **Reps:** 15-20
- **Sets:** 3
- **Rest:** 30-60 seconds
- **Frequency:** Daily
- **Focus:** Quality over speed

### As Warm-Up

- **Reps:** 15-20
- **Sets:** 2
- **When:** Before upper body workout
- **Purpose:** Activate upper back muscles

### Throughout the Day

- **Reps:** 10-15
- **When:** Every 1-2 hours at desk
- **Purpose:** Counter sitting posture
- **Note:** Keep band at desk for easy access

### Building Strength

- **Reps:** 12-15
- **Sets:** 3-4
- **Resistance:** Progressively heavier bands
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times per week

## Choosing the Right Band

### Resistance Levels

- **Light (yellow/tan often):** Beginners, high reps, or injured
- **Medium (red/green often):** Most people for posture work
- **Heavy (blue/black often):** Strength building, advanced

### Band Types

- **Loop bands:** Work well; may need to adjust grip position
- **Long flat bands:** Common choice; easy to adjust tension
- **Tube bands with handles:** Work but less ideal for this exercise

### Testing Resistance

You've chosen correctly if:
- You can do 15+ reps with good form
- You feel challenged by rep 12-15
- You can maintain shoulder depression throughout
