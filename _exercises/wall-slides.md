- Teach shoulders to move with proper scapular control
- Improve overhead reaching ability
- Activate muscles that support good posture
- Identify and address mobility limitations
- Great warm-up for upper body exercise

## How to Do Wall Slides

### Starting Position

1. Stand with back against wall
2. Feet 6-12 inches from wall
3. Press lower back, upper back, and head into wall
4. Raise arms to "goalpost" position (elbows at 90°, upper arms parallel to floor)
5. Try to keep forearms and backs of hands against wall

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Maintain contact between wall and:
- Lower back
- Upper back
- Head
- Elbows
- Wrists/hands (as much as possible)

**Step 2:** Slowly slide arms up the wall, straightening elbows

**Step 3:** Reach as high as you can while maintaining wall contact

**Step 4:** Slowly slide back down to starting position

**Step 5:** Repeat 10-15 times

### Key Points

- Move slowly and with control
- Keep ribs down (don't arch back)
- Maintain all contact points
- Don't shrug shoulders up

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Muscles working between and below shoulder blades
- Mild stretch across chest
- Shoulders moving smoothly
- Core engaging to keep back flat

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Shoulder joint pain
- Pinching in shoulders
- Numbness in arms
- Neck pain

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Can't Keep Arms on Wall

**Why:** Tight chest muscles, limited shoulder mobility

**What to do:**
- Start with arms further from wall
- Work on chest stretches separately
- Progress gradually

### Challenge 2: Back Arches Off Wall

**Why:** Tight lats, weak core, compensation for tight shoulders

**What to do:**
- Engage core more strongly
- Don't reach as high
- Address lat tightness

### Challenge 3: Shoulders Shrug Up

**Why:** Upper traps overactive, lower traps weak

**What to do:**
- Focus on keeping shoulders down
- Reduce range of motion
- Strengthen lower traps with other exercises

## Variations

### Beginner: Reduced Range

1. Don't slide all the way up
2. Only go as far as you can with good form
3. Progress range over time

### Foam Roller Wall Slides

1. Place foam roller between back and wall (vertical)
2. Perform wall slides with roller support
3. Adds feedback for keeping spine neutral

### Seated Wall Slides

1. Sit on floor with back against wall
2. Legs extended or crossed
3. Perform same sliding motion
4. Good for those with leg or balance issues

### Prone Floor Slides

1. Lie face down
2. Arms in goalpost position on floor
3. Slide arms up and back
4. More challenging for mobility

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do wall slides?

Daily is fine—they're low-intensity. Even 2-3 times per week provides benefit.

### Why can't I keep my arms against the wall?

Likely tight pec muscles and/or limited shoulder mobility. Keep practicing, but also stretch your chest separately.

### Are wall slides good for shoulder impingement?

They can be, as they train proper movement patterns. But if they cause pain, stop and consult a professional.

### What's the difference between wall slides and wall angels?

Very similar. Wall angels often involve more arm movement (like making a snow angel). Wall slides focus on the vertical slide motion. Both are beneficial.
