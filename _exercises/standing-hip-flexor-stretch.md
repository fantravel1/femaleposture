## Basic Standing Hip Flexor Stretch

### Setup

1. Stand in split stance (one foot forward, one back)
2. Feet about 2-3 feet apart
3. Both feet pointing forward
4. Back heel can lift slightly

### The Stretch

1. Bend front knee slightly
2. Keep back leg relatively straight
3. Tuck pelvis under (posterior tilt)
4. Shift hips forward slightly
5. Feel stretch in front of back hip
6. Hold 30-60 seconds
7. Switch sides

### Key Points

- Keep torso upright
- Don't arch your back
- The pelvic tuck is essential
- Squeeze back glute for deeper stretch
- Breathe normally

### With Arms Overhead

**Added stretch:**
1. Perform basic stretch
2. Raise arm (same side as back leg) overhead
3. Adds lateral trunk stretch
4. Deepens hip flexor stretch

### With Side Lean

**Deepest stretch:**
1. In stretch position
2. Arms overhead
3. Lean slightly away from back leg
4. Feel stretch from hip to side of torso

## What You Should Feel

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Arching Lower Back

**Problem:** Compensates, misses hip flexor
**Fix:** Tuck pelvis under firmly

### 2. Leaning Forward

**Problem:** Reduces stretch
**Fix:** Stay upright, chest up

### 3. Stance Too Short

**Problem:** Limits stretch
**Fix:** Feet 2-3 feet apart

### 4. Not Engaging Glute

**Problem:** Less effective stretch
**Fix:** Squeeze back-side glute
