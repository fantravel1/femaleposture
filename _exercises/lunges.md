# Lunges: Lower Body Strength for Posture

> **At a Glance:** Lunges build single-leg strength, hip stability, and balance—all essential for maintaining good posture throughout the day. They also stretch the hip flexors, which are often tight from sitting.

---

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Quads, glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors (stretch) |
| **Best For** | Leg strength, hip mobility, balance, pelvic stability |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner to Intermediate |
| **Equipment** | None (weights optional) |
| **Time** | 5 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 2-3 times per week |

## Why Lunges Help Posture

Strong legs and hips:
- Support your pelvis in neutral position
- Reduce lower back compensation
- Improve walking and standing mechanics
- Build single-leg stability

The lunge also stretches hip flexors, which:
- Become tight from sitting
- Pull the pelvis into anterior tilt
- Contribute to lower back pain

## The Basic Lunge (Forward Lunge)

### Starting Position

1. Stand tall, feet hip-width apart
2. Hands on hips or at sides
3. Core engaged
4. Eyes forward

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Step forward with right foot (medium-large step)

**Step 2:** Lower body by bending both knees

**Step 3:** Front knee tracks over toes (not past them)

**Step 4:** Back knee drops toward floor (don't slam it down)

**Step 5:** Lower until front thigh is parallel to floor (or as low as comfortable)

**Step 6:** Push through front heel to return to start

**Step 7:** Repeat on same side or alternate

### Key Points

- Torso stays upright throughout
- Front knee stays behind or over toes
- Back knee points straight down
- Core engaged, no excessive lean

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Quads and glutes working in front leg
- Stretch in hip flexor of back leg
- Core engaging for balance
- Glutes firing to push back up

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Knee pain (front knee)
- Loss of balance (use support)
- Lower back pain
- Hip pinching

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Knee Caving In

**What happens:** Front knee collapses inward
**Why it's wrong:** Stresses knee, indicates weak hips
**Fix:** Actively push knee out over toes; strengthen hip abductors

### Mistake 2: Knee Too Far Forward

**What happens:** Front knee extends past toes significantly
**Why it's wrong:** Increases knee stress
**Fix:** Take a longer step; focus on lowering down, not forward

### Mistake 3: Leaning Forward

**What happens:** Torso tips forward over front leg
**Why it's wrong:** Puts stress on lower back; loses core engagement
**Fix:** Stay upright; engage core; eyes forward

### Mistake 4: Short Step

**What happens:** Step is too short
**Why it's wrong:** Creates awkward position; knee goes too far forward
**Fix:** Take a longer step—front shin should be roughly vertical at bottom

### Mistake 5: Rushing

**What happens:** Fast, bouncy movements
**Why it's wrong:** Loses control and muscle engagement
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movement; pause at bottom if needed

## Lunge Variations

### Reverse Lunge

Easier on the knees than forward lunges.

1. Start standing
2. Step backward with one leg
3. Lower down
4. Push through front heel to return
5. Often preferred for beginners

### Walking Lunges

Continuous movement for more challenge.

1. Lunge forward
2. Push up and step through
3. Lunge with opposite leg
4. Continue walking
5. Requires space and good balance

### Static Lunge (Split Squat)

Stay in lunge position for the whole set.

1. Start in lunge position (feet stay planted)
2. Lower and rise without moving feet
3. Complete all reps on one side
4. Switch sides
5. Great for building strength and control

### Bulgarian Split Squat

Advanced single-leg exercise.

1. Back foot elevated on bench or step
2. Front foot forward
3. Lower down
4. Push through front leg
5. Excellent for glutes and quads

### Lateral Lunge (Side Lunge)

Works different muscles and movement plane.

1. Step wide to the side
2. Bend stepping leg, keep other straight
3. Push back to center
4. Works inner and outer thighs

## Programming

### For Beginners

- **Variation:** Static lunge or reverse lunge
- **Sets:** 2
- **Reps:** 8-10 each leg
- **Weight:** Bodyweight only
- **Frequency:** 2x per week

### For Building Strength

- **Variation:** Any variation
- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 10-12 each leg
- **Weight:** Add dumbbells when ready
- **Frequency:** 2-3x per week

### For Hip Flexor Stretch Benefit

- **Variation:** Low lunge hold
- **Duration:** 30-60 seconds each side
- **Focus:** Sink hips down, tuck pelvis slightly
- **Frequency:** Daily if hip flexors are tight

## Modifications

### Assisted Lunges

- Hold onto wall, chair, or counter
- Helps with balance while building strength
- Good for beginners or those with balance issues

### Shorter Range of Motion

- Don't lower all the way
- Stop where comfortable
- Build depth gradually

### Hands on Thighs

- For balance assistance
- Push on thigh to help stand up
- Progression toward hands-free

---

## Stretching Benefit: The Low Lunge Hold

Beyond strength, lunges can stretch hip flexors:

1. Get into lunge position
2. Drop back knee to floor (padded)
3. Sink hips forward and down
4. Tuck tailbone slightly (posterior tilt)
5. Feel stretch in front of back hip
6. Hold 30-60 seconds
7. Great for counteracting sitting

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are lunges bad for knees?

Not inherently. Poor form or pre-existing issues can make them uncomfortable. Try reverse lunges (often easier on knees) and focus on proper knee tracking.

### Should I do lunges if I have tight hip flexors?

Yes—they can help! The back leg gets a hip flexor stretch during the lunge. Add the low lunge hold for even more benefit.

### How deep should I lunge?

Until front thigh is roughly parallel to floor, or as deep as you can maintain good form. Depth improves with practice.

### Lunges or squats—which is better?

Both! Squats are bilateral (two-leg), lunges are unilateral (single-leg emphasis). Both have unique benefits. Include both if possible.
