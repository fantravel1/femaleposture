# Hip Thrusts: Advanced Glute Strengthening

> **At a Glance:** Hip thrusts are one of the most effective exercises for glute strength. Strong glutes support the pelvis and contribute to better posture.

---

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Gluteus maximus, hamstrings, core |
| **Best For** | Glute strength, pelvic stability, hip extension |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Equipment** | Bench (for elevated version), barbell optional |
| **Time** | 5-10 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 2-3x per week |

## Why Hip Thrusts Help Posture

Strong glutes:
- Stabilize the pelvis
- Support hip extension
- Counter anterior pelvic tilt
- Reduce lower back strain
- Support proper standing posture

Hip thrusts target glutes more effectively than most other exercises.

## Bodyweight Hip Thrust

### Setup

1. Sit on floor with upper back against bench/couch
2. Shoulder blades at edge of bench
3. Feet flat on floor, hip-width apart
4. Knees bent about 90 degrees

### The Movement

1. Brace core
2. Drive through heels
3. Lift hips until body forms straight line from shoulders to knees
4. Squeeze glutes hard at top
5. Lower with control
6. Repeat 12-15 times

### Key Points

- Don't hyperextend lower back at top
- Chin tucked (don't look at ceiling)
- Drive through heels, not toes
- Full glute squeeze at top

---

## Progressions

### Floor Glute Bridge

**Easier starting point:**
- No bench needed
- Shoulders on floor
- Same hip extension pattern
- [See glute bridges guide](/exercises/glute-bridges/)

### Bodyweight Hip Thrust

As described above—elevated on bench.

### Single-Leg Hip Thrust

**More challenging:**
1. One foot on floor, one raised
2. Perform thrust on one leg
3. 8-10 reps each side
4. Significantly harder

### Weighted Hip Thrust

**Adding load:**
1. Barbell across hips
2. Use pad for comfort
3. Same movement pattern
4. Start light, progress gradually

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Glutes burning
- Glutes doing the work (not just hamstrings or lower back)
- Core engaged
- Powerful hip extension

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Lower back pain
- Hip joint pain
- Hamstring cramping (may indicate glutes not engaging)
- Knee pain

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Hyperextending Lower Back

**Problem:** Arching too much at top
**Fix:** Stop when hips align with torso, keep core engaged

### 2. Pushing Through Toes

**Problem:** Quads taking over
**Fix:** Drive through heels, even lift toes slightly

### 3. Not Engaging Glutes

**Problem:** Hamstrings and lower back doing the work
**Fix:** Focus on squeezing glutes; try pause at top

### 4. Looking Up

**Problem:** Neck strain
**Fix:** Tuck chin, look straight ahead at top

### 5. Bench Too High or Low

**Problem:** Affects range of motion
**Fix:** Shoulder blades should rest on edge of bench

## Programming

### For Glute Development

- 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps
- 2-3 times per week
- Progressive overload (add weight over time)

### For Posture Support

- 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps
- 2-3 times per week
- Focus on activation over weight

### In Lower Body Workout

- Include as primary or secondary glute exercise
- Pair with other hip movements
- Can superset with other exercises

---

## Hip Thrust Variations

### Frog Pump

- Feet together, knees out
- Squeeze glutes to lift
- Good for activation

### Band Hip Thrust

- Band around knees
- Adds hip abduction component
- Resists knee caving

### Tempo Hip Thrust

- Slow eccentric (3-4 seconds down)
- Increases time under tension
- Great for hypertrophy

---

## Who Benefits Most

Hip thrusts are especially helpful for:
- Anyone wanting stronger glutes
- People with anterior pelvic tilt
- Those with weak hip extension
- Athletes needing power
- Runners
- Anyone wanting to improve pelvic stability

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How heavy should I go?

Start bodyweight, then add load gradually. You should be able to complete all reps with good form.

### Why do my hamstrings cramp?

Usually means glutes aren't engaging. Focus on glute squeeze, drive through heels. May need to regress to floor bridges first.

### Can I do hip thrusts without a bench?

Yes. Use floor glute bridges, or use a stable couch/sturdy chair at home.

### How is this different from glute bridges?

Hip thrust has more range of motion due to elevation. Generally more challenging and allows more loading.
