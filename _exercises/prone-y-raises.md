# Prone Y-Raises: Strengthen Your Lower Traps

> **At a Glance:** Prone Y-raises target the lower trapezius—a muscle that's often weak and underactive. Strengthening it helps pull your shoulders back and down, counteracting the rounded posture from desk work.

## Why This Exercise Matters

The lower trapezius:
- Pulls shoulder blades down and together
- Stabilizes shoulders during arm movement
- Counteracts upper trap dominance
- Essential for upright posture

When weak:
- Upper traps take over (neck tension)
- Shoulders creep up and forward
- Rounded posture develops
- Shoulder problems increase

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Lifting Head

**What happens:** Head cranes up to look forward
**Why it's wrong:** Strains neck, changes muscle recruitment
**Fix:** Keep forehead down throughout

### Mistake 2: Shrugging Shoulders

**What happens:** Shoulders rise toward ears
**Why it's wrong:** Uses upper traps instead of lower
**Fix:** Actively pull shoulders down as you lift

### Mistake 3: Arms Too High

**What happens:** Arms above shoulder line (more like overhead)
**Why it's wrong:** Changes target muscles
**Fix:** 45-degree angle from body (Y, not I)

### Mistake 4: Using Momentum

**What happens:** Swinging arms up quickly
**Why it's wrong:** Loses muscle engagement
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movement (2-3 seconds each direction)
