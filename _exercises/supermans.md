## How to Do Supermans

### Starting Position

1. Lie face down on mat
2. Arms extended overhead
3. Legs straight behind you
4. Forehead on mat
5. Neck in neutral

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Engage core by drawing navel toward spine

**Step 2:** Simultaneously lift:

- Legs (keeping them straight)

**Step 3:** Hold at top for 2-3 seconds

**Step 4:** Lower with control

**Step 5:** Repeat 10-15 times

### Key Points

- Keep neck neutral (don't crane head up)
- Breathe throughout (exhale on lift)

- Squeeze glutes at top
- Move slowly and controlled

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Overextending Neck

**Problem:** Looking up too much, crunching neck
**Fix:** Keep neck neutral, look at floor just ahead

### 2. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Not breathing during effort
**Fix:** Exhale as you lift, breathe throughout hold

### 3. Using Momentum

**Problem:** Jerking into position
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movement; hold at top

### 4. Lifting Too High

**Problem:** Hyperextending lower back
**Fix:** Only lift as high as comfortable

### 5. Forgetting Glutes

**Problem:** Only using lower back
**Fix:** Actively squeeze glutes to help lift legs

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are Supermans safe for my back?

For most people, yes. Start with easier variations if you have concerns. Stop if painful. Not recommended during acute back pain episodes.

### How often should I do Supermans?

2-3 times per week with rest between sessions. Daily at low volume is also an option.

### I can't lift very high—is that okay?

Yes. Height doesn't matter as much as muscle engagement. Lift what you can with good form.

### Can Supermans replace deadlifts?

No. They're complementary. Supermans are lighter, isolation-style. Deadlifts are heavy, compound. Both are valuable for different purposes.
