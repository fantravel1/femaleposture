# Mountain Pose (Tadasana)

> **The Foundation:** Mountain pose may look like "just standing," but it's actually the blueprint for proper alignment. Master this pose, and you have a template for good posture you can return to anytime.

## Why Mountain Pose Matters

Mountain pose teaches:

- **Optimal alignment** from feet to head
- **Body awareness** of how you hold yourself
- **Active standing** versus passive slouching
- **Foundation** for all other standing poses
- **A reset** you can do anywhere, anytime

## How to Do Mountain Pose

### Feet

1. Stand with feet together or hip-width apart
2. Spread toes wide, press evenly through all four corners of feet
3. Lift arches slightly (don't collapse inward)
4. Weight distributed evenly between both feet

### Legs

1. Engage thigh muscles (kneecaps lift slightly)
2. Don't lock knees—keep micro-bend
3. Inner thighs rotate slightly inward
4. Tailbone points down (neutral pelvis)

### Torso

1. Lengthen spine upward
2. Draw lower ribs in (don't flare)
3. Core gently engaged
4. Chest open, shoulders back

### Arms

1. Arms alongside body
2. Palms facing forward or toward thighs
3. Fingers active, reaching down
4. Shoulders roll back and down

### Head

1. Chin parallel to floor
2. Back of neck long
3. Crown of head reaching toward ceiling
4. Gaze forward, soft focus

## The Alignment Checkpoints

Use this mental checklist:

1. **Feet:** Grounded, weight even
2. **Knees:** Soft, not locked
3. **Pelvis:** Neutral, tailbone down
4. **Core:** Gently engaged
5. **Ribs:** In line (not flaring)
6. **Shoulders:** Back and down
7. **Chin:** Level, not jutting forward
8. **Crown:** Reaching upward

## Common Mistakes

### Locking Knees
**Problem:** Stresses joints, throws off alignment
**Fix:** Keep slight bend, engage thighs

### Anterior Pelvic Tilt
**Problem:** Lower back arches excessively
**Fix:** Tuck tailbone slightly, engage lower abs

### Shoulders Rounding Forward
**Problem:** Closes chest, strains upper back
**Fix:** Roll shoulders back and down, open collarbone

### Chin Jutting Forward
**Problem:** Forward head posture
**Fix:** Draw chin back slightly, lengthen back of neck

### Weight on Heels
**Problem:** Throws off balance and alignment
**Fix:** Distribute weight evenly across whole foot

## Modifications

### Against a Wall
- Stand with back against wall
- Head, shoulders, and hips touch wall
- Small gap at lower back (natural curve)
- Great for learning proper alignment

### With Block Between Thighs
- Squeeze block between upper thighs
- Activates inner thighs and helps align legs
- Useful for correcting knock-knees

### Arms Overhead
- Extend arms toward ceiling
- Shoulders stay down (away from ears)
- Adds upper body engagement

## Mountain Pose as Daily Reset

Use mountain pose throughout your day:

### At Your Desk
- Stand up periodically
- Find mountain pose alignment
- Hold for 5-10 breaths
- Return to work with better awareness

### In Line/Waiting
- Instead of slouching
- Practice mountain pose alignment
- Nobody will know you're doing yoga

### Before Important Moments
- Before meetings, presentations, difficult conversations
- Mountain pose creates confidence and presence
- Calm your nervous system with aligned breathing

## Testing Your Mountain Pose

### The Wall Test
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Heels about 2 inches from wall
3. Touch wall with: head, upper back, hips
4. There should be a small gap at lower back
5. If head doesn't touch easily, you may have forward head posture

### The Mirror Check
1. Stand sideways to a mirror
2. Check: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, hips over ankles
3. Notice where your alignment deviates

---

## For Specific Conditions

### Forward Head Posture
Focus on drawing chin back and lengthening the back of neck. Practice against wall to feel proper head position.

### Rounded Shoulders
Emphasize rolling shoulders back and opening chest. Think of widening across collarbones.

### Anterior Pelvic Tilt
Focus on neutral pelvis. Slight core engagement helps. Don't over-correct into posterior tilt.

### Flat Back
Maintain natural spinal curves. Don't over-tuck tailbone or flatten lower back.
