# Doorway Chest Stretch: Open Tight Shoulders

> **At a Glance:** The doorway stretch is one of the most effective ways to stretch tight chest and front shoulder muscles. These muscles shorten from desk work and phone use, pulling shoulders forward. This simple stretch helps restore balance.

---

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, anterior deltoid |
| **Best For** | Rounded shoulders, tight chest, desk workers |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | Doorway |
| **Time** | 2-3 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 2-3 times daily |

---

## Why This Stretch Works

When chest muscles are tight:
- They pull shoulders forward and inward
- Upper back muscles become overstretched
- Rounded shoulder posture develops
- Neck and upper back strain increases

The doorway stretch:
- Lengthens shortened chest muscles
- Opens the front of the shoulder
- Allows shoulders to move back naturally
- Counteracts desk and phone posture
- Can be done anywhere with a doorway

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Starting Position

1. Stand in a doorway
2. Place forearms on door frame, elbows at shoulder height
3. Elbows bent at 90 degrees
4. One foot slightly in front of the other for balance
5. Stand tall with core gently engaged

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Keep your forearms pressed against the door frame

**Step 2:** Slowly lean your body forward through the doorway

**Step 3:** Keep your back straight—don't arch your lower back

**Step 4:** Feel the stretch across your chest and front of shoulders

**Step 5:** Hold for 30-60 seconds

**Step 6:** Breathe deeply throughout—don't hold breath

**Step 7:** Slowly return to starting position

**Step 8:** Repeat 2-3 times

### Breathing

- Breathe slowly and deeply throughout
- Use exhales to gently deepen the stretch
- Never hold your breath
- Let breathing help you relax into the stretch

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Stretch across chest muscles
- Stretch in front of shoulders
- Gradual release of tension
- Opening sensation in front of body

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Sharp pain in shoulder joint
- Numbness or tingling in arms
- Pain that radiates down arm

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Arching Lower Back

**What it looks like:** Belly pushing forward, excessive curve in lower back
**Why it's wrong:** Compensates for tight chest; strains lower back
**How to fix:** Engage core; keep ribs down; think "tall spine"

### Mistake 2: Shrugging Shoulders

**What it looks like:** Shoulders raised toward ears
**Why it's wrong:** Creates neck tension; reduces stretch effectiveness
**How to fix:** Consciously drop shoulders down before and during stretch

### Mistake 3: Elbows Too High or Low

**What it looks like:** Elbows above head or down by sides
**Why it's wrong:** Changes which fibers are stretched
**How to fix:** Keep elbows at shoulder height for standard stretch

### Mistake 4: Leaning Head Forward

**What it looks like:** Head jutting forward as you lean
**Why it's wrong:** Strains neck; perpetuates forward head posture
**How to fix:** Keep head in line with spine; chin neutral

### Mistake 5: Rushing Through

**What it looks like:** Quick 10-second holds
**Why it's wrong:** Not long enough for tissue change
**How to fix:** Hold at least 30 seconds; 60 seconds is better

## Arm Position Variations

Different arm positions stretch different parts of the chest.

### Low Position (Below Shoulder)

- Elbows below shoulder height
- Emphasizes upper chest (clavicular fibers)
- Often feels more intense

### Middle Position (At Shoulder)

- Elbows at shoulder height
- Standard position
- Stretches middle chest fibers

### High Position (Above Shoulder)

- Elbows above shoulder height
- Emphasizes lower chest
- Also stretches pec minor more

**Best practice:** Do all three positions for comprehensive stretch.

## Modifications and Variations

### Making It Easier

**Single-Arm Stretch:**
1. Stand beside wall or door frame
2. Place one forearm on surface
3. Turn body away from arm
4. Less intense, easier to control

**Corner Stretch:**
1. Stand facing a corner
2. Place one hand on each wall
3. Lean into corner
4. Similar effect without doorway

### Making It More Intense

**Deeper Lean:**
1. Step further forward into doorway
2. Increase lean
3. Only if you can maintain form

**With Rotation:**
1. In single-arm position
2. Add slight rotation away from stretched arm
3. Deepens stretch

**With Hold:**
1. Hold position for 2+ minutes
2. Allow muscle to fully relax
3. More significant tissue change

## Programming

### For Daily Maintenance

- **Duration:** 30 seconds each position
- **Positions:** Low, middle, high
- **Sets:** 1-2 rounds
- **Frequency:** 2-3 times daily

### For Significant Tightness

- **Duration:** 60 seconds each position
- **Positions:** All three
- **Sets:** 2-3 rounds
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times daily

### In a Routine

**Best paired with:**
- Upper trap stretch
- Chin tucks
- Wall angels
- Thoracic extension

**Sample desk break sequence:**
1. **Doorway stretch (30 sec each position)**
2. Chin tucks (10 reps)
3. Shoulder rolls (10 each direction)

## When to Do This Stretch

**Best times:**
- After waking (counteract sleep position)
- During work breaks
- After computer/phone use
- Before upper body exercise
- Before bed

**Especially important:**
- After prolonged desk work
- After driving
- If you catch yourself hunching
- Any time shoulders feel tight

## Special Considerations

### With Shoulder Issues

- Start with single-arm version
- Use lighter intensity
- Avoid positions that cause pain
- May need to limit range
- Consult PT if persistent issues

### During Pregnancy

- Generally safe throughout
- May need to adjust stance for balance
- Don't overstretch (relaxin increases flexibility)
- Stop if any discomfort

### Postpartum

- Safe and helpful
- Counteracts breastfeeding posture
- Do after nursing sessions
- Start gentle and progress

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until I see results?

With consistent stretching (2-3x daily), most people notice improved range of motion within 2-4 weeks. Postural changes take 6-8 weeks of consistent work.

### Should the stretch hurt?

No. You should feel a stretch, not pain. If it hurts, reduce intensity. Pain means you've gone too far.

### Can I do this stretch too much?

For most people, no—it's safe to do multiple times daily. However, if you feel sore or overstretched, reduce frequency.

### What if I don't have a doorway?

Use a corner, wall, or any vertical surface. The single-arm version works well with just a wall.
