## What Is the Piriformis?

The piriformis is a small muscle deep in your buttock, running from your sacrum (base of spine) to your outer hip. It's responsible for:
- Rotating your hip outward
- Stabilizing your hip
- Helping you walk and move

### Why Does It Matter?

The sciatic nerve runs either through or under the piriformis muscle in most people. When the piriformis is tight or spasms, it can:
- Compress the sciatic nerve
- Cause pain in the buttock
- Create shooting pain down the leg
- Mimic sciatica symptoms

This is called **piriformis syndrome**.

## Who Benefits from This Stretch?

This stretch helps if you:
- Have sciatic-type pain
- Sit for long periods
- Do activities involving hip rotation (running, dancing)
- Have one leg that rotates out more than the other
- Experience tightness deep in your buttock

## Figure-4 Piriformis Stretch (Lying)

The most common and effective variation.

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back, knees bent, feet on floor
2. Cross right ankle over left knee (figure-4 position)
3. Right knee points outward
4. Head rests on floor

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Thread right arm through the "window" (space between legs)

**Step 2:** Clasp hands behind left thigh or on left shin

**Step 3:** Lift left foot off floor, bringing left knee toward chest

**Step 4:** Keep right ankle flexed (not pointed)

**Step 5:** Gently press right knee away with right elbow

**Step 6:** Feel stretch deep in right buttock

**Step 7:** Hold 30-60 seconds

**Step 8:** Switch sides

### Key Points

- Keep head and shoulders relaxed on floor
- Don't force—ease into the stretch
- Breathe normally throughout
- The stretch should feel deep in the glute, not sharp

## Seated Piriformis Stretch

Great for office or when lying down isn't possible.

### Starting Position

1. Sit in a sturdy chair
2. Feet flat on floor
3. Sit tall with good posture
4. Cross right ankle over left knee

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Keep right ankle flexed

**Step 2:** Gently press right knee down toward floor

**Step 3:** Sit up tall (don't round forward)

**Step 4:** For deeper stretch, hinge forward from hips (keeping back straight)

**Step 5:** Feel stretch in right buttock

**Step 6:** Hold 30-60 seconds

**Step 7:** Switch sides

## Pigeon Pose (Yoga Variation)

A deeper stretch for those with adequate flexibility.

### Starting Position

1. Start on hands and knees
2. Bring right knee forward toward right wrist
3. Right ankle near left hip (or further toward left wrist for deeper stretch)
4. Extend left leg straight back

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Keep hips level (don't tilt to one side)

**Step 2:** Walk hands forward to lower torso

**Step 3:** Rest on forearms or all the way to the floor

**Step 4:** Relax into the stretch

**Step 5:** Hold 1-2 minutes

**Step 6:** Switch sides

### Caution

This is an intense stretch. If your hips lift off the floor significantly on the bent leg side, use a blanket or block under that hip for support.

---

## Supine Piriformis Stretch (Modified)

Gentler variation for beginners or those with limited flexibility.

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back near a wall
2. Bend both knees, feet on wall
3. Cross right ankle over left knee

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Right knee points toward wall

**Step 2:** Press right knee gently away from you

**Step 3:** Scoot closer to wall for deeper stretch

**Step 4:** Hold 30-60 seconds

**Step 5:** Switch sides

### Why Use the Wall?

- Provides support for the back
- Makes it easier to control stretch intensity
- Good for beginners or those with back issues

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Deep stretch in buttock muscle
- Mild tension, not pain
- Sensation may spread to outer hip
- Gradual relaxation of tight muscle

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Sharp pain
- Numbness or tingling that worsens
- Pain in the knee (adjust ankle position)
- Lower back pain

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forcing the Stretch

**What happens:** Pushing too hard into the stretch
**Why it's wrong:** Can aggravate the nerve or strain the muscle
**Fix:** Ease in gradually; hold where you feel stretch, not pain

### Mistake 2: Letting the Ankle Point

**What happens:** Foot dangles instead of staying flexed
**Why it's wrong:** Doesn't protect the knee; reduces effectiveness
**Fix:** Keep ankle flexed (toes toward shin)

### Mistake 3: Rounding the Back (Seated)

**What happens:** Slouching forward to get a deeper stretch
**Why it's wrong:** Strains lower back; loses the hip stretch
**Fix:** Hinge from hips with straight back

### Mistake 4: Holding Breath

**What happens:** Tensing up and not breathing
**Why it's wrong:** Prevents muscle relaxation
**Fix:** Breathe smoothly; try exhaling to deepen stretch

## Special Considerations

### During Pregnancy

The piriformis stretch is generally safe and often helpful during pregnancy:
- Sciatica is common in pregnancy
- Use the lying position with pillow under head
- Avoid deep pigeon pose in late pregnancy
- Listen to your body

### If You Have True Sciatica

Piriformis stretching may or may not help:
- If piriformis syndrome is the cause, stretching helps
- If a herniated disc is the cause, it may not be enough
- Worth trying, but see a professional if no improvement

### After Hip Replacement

Consult your surgeon. This stretch may be contraindicated in the early healing phase depending on your surgical approach.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I stretch my piriformis?

If it's tight or causing problems, daily stretching is appropriate. Once symptoms improve, 3-5 times per week for maintenance.

### Can piriformis stretching make things worse?

If you have a true disc issue causing your sciatica, piriformis stretching won't help and could potentially irritate things. If symptoms worsen with stretching, stop and see a professional.

### How do I know if I have piriformis syndrome?

Signs include:
- Pain deep in the buttock
- Pain that worsens with sitting
- Pain with hip rotation
- Tenderness when pressing on the piriformis
- Sciatica-like symptoms that respond to piriformis stretching

Diagnosis should be confirmed by a healthcare provider.

### Why is my piriformis always tight?

Common causes:
- Prolonged sitting
- Running or cycling
- Weak glutes (piriformis compensates)
- Pelvic imbalance
- Standing with weight on one leg

Address the cause along with stretching.
