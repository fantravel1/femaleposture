## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I hold this stretch?

30-60 seconds per side. Longer holds (up to 2 minutes) for very tight areas.

### Can I do this if I have sciatica?

It may help, but if symptoms worsen, stop. Some people find it relieves symptoms; others find it aggravating.

### Why does one side feel tighter?

Asymmetry is normal. May be from dominant leg use, sleeping position, or past injury. Work both sides, possibly extra on tight side.

### Is this the same as piriformis stretch?

Similar. Figure four targets the same area as many piriformis stretches. It's one of several effective options.
