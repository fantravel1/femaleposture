## Why the 90/90 Position Matters

This stretch addresses hip rotation, which is:
- Often limited in modern lifestyles
- Important for squatting, lunging, and walking
- Connected to lower back and knee health
- Critical for athletic movements
- Frequently overlooked in typical stretching

## How to Do the 90/90 Stretch

### Getting Into Position

1. Sit on floor with right leg in front
2. Bend right knee to 90 degrees
3. Right shin parallel to your body (or angled slightly)
4. Left leg to the side, also bent 90 degrees
5. Left shin perpendicular to body
6. Both knees bent at 90 degrees (hence the name)

### The Position

- Front leg: Hip externally rotated
- Back leg: Hip internally rotated
- Torso: Upright as much as possible
- Sit bones: Ideally both on floor (but this takes time)

### Basic Stretch

**Hold:**
1. Sit tall in the position
2. Hold 30-60 seconds
3. Switch sides

**Add movement:**
1. Lean slightly forward over front leg
2. Come back upright
3. Optional: Side bend away from front leg
4. 10-15 reps of gentle movement

---

## Modifications

### If You Can't Get Into Position

**Elevated setup:**
- Sit on yoga block or cushion
- This reduces demand on hips
- Work toward floor over time

**Wider back leg:**
- Don't force 90 degrees on back leg
- Start with what your hip allows
- Progress gradually

**Hands for support:**
- Place hands on floor behind you
- Take some weight off hips
- Allows you to work in position

### Common Limitations

**Tight hip external rotation:**
- Front leg won't go down
- Front knee rises up
- Sit on block to compensate

**Tight hip internal rotation:**
- Back leg uncomfortable
- Back knee lifts
- Widen the angle of back leg

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

**Front hip:**
- Stretch in outer hip/glute
- Similar to pigeon pose feeling

**Back hip:**
- Stretch in front of hip
- May feel in inner thigh
- Intensity in outer hip

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Knee pain (either knee)
- Sharp hip pain
- Pinching in hip
- SI joint pain

---

## Progressions

### Level 1: Elevated

- Sit on block or cushion
- Use hand support
- Hold 20-30 seconds
- Basic position work

### Level 2: Floor

- Sit on floor
- Minimal hand support
- Hold 30-60 seconds
- Add gentle movement

### Level 3: Active

- No hand support
- Add forward lean
- Add rotation
- Hold 60-90 seconds

### Level 4: Transitions

- Switch sides smoothly
- 90/90 transitions (windshield wipers)
- Flow through positions

## 90/90 Windshield Wipers

### How to Do Them

This dynamic version transitions between sides:

1. Start in 90/90 position
2. Lift both knees
3. Rotate legs to opposite side
4. Set down in 90/90 on other side
5. Repeat back and forth
6. 10-15 transitions

### Benefits

- Develops active mobility
- Builds hip strength in ranges
- More dynamic than static stretch
- Great for warm-ups

---

## Programming the 90/90

### Daily Practice

**Quick version (2-3 minutes):**
- 30 seconds each side, basic hold
- 10 windshield wipers

**Full version (5-10 minutes):**
- 60 seconds each side
- Add movement
- 15-20 windshield wipers

### As Part of Warm-Up

- After initial movement
- 30 seconds each side
- 10 transitions
- Progress to lower body work

### In Flexibility Routine

- After warming up
- 60-90 seconds each side
- Add forward leans
- Combine with other hip stretches

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Forcing the Position

**Problem:** Pushing past what your hips allow
**Fix:** Use modifications, progress gradually

### 2. Collapsing Posture

**Problem:** Rounding back, leaning away
**Fix:** Sit tall, use props if needed

### 3. Feet Not Flexed

**Problem:** Pointed toes can stress knees
**Fix:** Keep ankles flexed for knee protection

### 4. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Creates tension
**Fix:** Breathe deeply throughout

### 5. Skipping Weaker Side

**Problem:** Imbalance continues
**Fix:** Equal time on both sides (or extra on tight side)

## Who Benefits Most

The 90/90 stretch is especially helpful for:
- Anyone with limited hip mobility
- Athletes (especially rotational sports)
- People who want to sit on the floor
- Those with lower back stiffness
- Anyone working on squatting depth
- CrossFitters and weightlifters

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is one side so much harder?

Asymmetry is common. Most people have one hip tighter in rotation. Work both sides, possibly extra time on the tight side.

### My knee hurts in this position—what should I do?

Stop and modify. Knee pain usually means you're forcing too much rotation. Elevate yourself and/or widen the angle of the problem leg.

### How long until I can sit flat?

This varies widely. Some people take months to years. Many never sit completely flat, but improve significantly. Be patient.

### Can I do this with bad hips?

Depends on your condition. If you have hip pathology, consult a professional first. Many people with hip issues can do modified versions.
