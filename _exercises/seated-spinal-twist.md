## Why This Stretch Helps

Your thoracic spine is designed to rotate. But sitting all day:
- Locks the spine in one position
- Reduces rotational mobility over time
- Creates stiffness and tension

Regular twisting:
- Maintains thoracic rotation
- Releases mid-back tension
- Improves overall spinal mobility
- Feels great

## Seated Twist (Chair Version)

### Starting Position

1. Sit sideways in chair
2. Feet flat on floor
3. Sit tall with neutral spine
4. Right side of body toward chair back

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Place both hands on chair back

**Step 2:** Inhale and lengthen spine (sit taller)

**Step 3:** Exhale and rotate torso toward chair back

**Step 4:** Use hands to gently assist the rotation

**Step 5:** Keep hips facing forward (twist comes from spine)

**Step 6:** Hold for 30-60 seconds

**Step 7:** Release slowly and switch sides

### Key Points

- Initiate rotation from thoracic spine, not lumbar
- Keep both sit bones grounded
- Don't force—gentle pressure only
- Breathe throughout

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forcing the Twist

**What happens:** Using hands to push hard into rotation
**Why it's wrong:** Can strain back; loses the gentle release
**Fix:** Gentle assistance only; let breath deepen the twist

### Mistake 2: Rotating from Lower Back

**What happens:** Lumbar spine does the twisting
**Why it's wrong:** Lumbar has limited rotation; can strain it
**Fix:** Focus on mid-back rotation; keep lower back relatively stable

### Mistake 3: Collapsing Posture

**What happens:** Slumping as you twist
**Why it's wrong:** Loses thoracic mobility benefit
**Fix:** Lengthen spine before and during twist

### Mistake 4: Holding Breath

**What happens:** Breath stops during twist
**Why it's wrong:** Increases tension; limits depth of stretch
**Fix:** Breathe smoothly; exhale to deepen twist

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often can I do seated twists?

As often as you like—multiple times daily is fine and beneficial. It's a gentle mobility movement, not an intense stretch.

### Should it crack/pop?

Sometimes popping happens and is usually harmless. Don't force or try to get pops.

### Is this safe for my lower back?

Generally yes, as long as the rotation happens in your thoracic spine. If you have disc issues, check with a provider.

### Can I do this during pregnancy?

Yes, with modifications. Twist gently, don't compress belly, and reduce range of motion as pregnancy progresses.
