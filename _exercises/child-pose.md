## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I hold child's pose?

As long as feels good—anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes. It's a rest position, so let your body guide you.

### Why can't I get my forehead to the floor?

Tight hips, back, or thighs. Use a pillow or block under your forehead. Forcing it doesn't help.

### Is child's pose good for lower back pain?

Often yes—it gently stretches and decompresses the lower back. But if it increases pain, stop.

### Can I do child's pose with knee problems?

It depends on the problem. Try modifications (padding, not sitting back fully). Skip it if it causes knee pain.
