## Why Neck Mobility Matters

Good cervical mobility:
- Allows comfortable head movement
- Reduces muscle tension
- Helps with driving (checking blind spots)
- Prevents compensatory movements
- Supports overall neck health

---

## Basic Neck Rotations

### Setup

1. Sit or stand tall
2. Shoulders relaxed
3. Head in neutral (ears over shoulders)
4. Look straight ahead

### The Movement

1. Slowly turn head to the right
2. Go to comfortable end range
3. Pause briefly
4. Return to center
5. Turn to the left
6. Return to center
7. Repeat 5-10 times each side

### Key Points

- Move slowly and smoothly
- Don't force the movement
- Keep shoulders still
- Breathe normally
- Stop if you feel pain

---

## Variations

### Slow Controlled Rotation

**For mobility work:**
1. 3-5 seconds to turn each direction
2. Brief pause at end range
3. 5 reps each side
4. Focus on smoothness

### Rotation with Hold

**For gentle stretching:**
1. Turn to one side
2. Hold 10-15 seconds
3. Return to center
4. Repeat other side
5. 2-3 holds each side

### Chin Tuck with Rotation

**Combined movement:**
1. Perform chin tuck first
2. Maintain tuck while rotating
3. This targets different muscles
4. Good for forward head posture

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Moving Too Fast

**Problem:** Misses benefit, can strain muscles
**Fix:** Slow, deliberate movement

### 2. Forcing Range

**Problem:** Can cause injury
**Fix:** Go only to comfortable end range

### 3. Shoulders Moving

**Problem:** Compensating, not isolating neck
**Fix:** Keep shoulders still

### 4. Poor Starting Position

**Problem:** Starting in poor posture
**Fix:** Begin with good alignment
