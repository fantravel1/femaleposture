# Squats: Foundation Exercise for Posture

> **At a Glance:** The squat is a fundamental human movement pattern that strengthens your legs, hips, and core. Strong legs and glutes support your pelvis and spine, making squats essential for posture.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Quads, glutes, hamstrings, core, back |
| **Best For** | Leg strength, hip mobility, functional movement |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner to Advanced |
| **Equipment** | None (weights optional) |
| **Time** | 5-10 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 2-3 times per week |

## Why Squats Help Posture

Strong legs and glutes:
- Support your pelvis in neutral position
- Take load off your lower back
- Enable proper movement patterns
- Provide the foundation for standing and walking

The squat movement also:
- Requires core engagement
- Develops hip mobility
- Builds bone density (weight-bearing)
- Improves functional strength

## The Bodyweight Squat

Master this before adding weight.

### Starting Position

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart (or slightly wider)
2. Toes pointing slightly outward (15-30 degrees)
3. Arms at sides or in front for balance
4. Core engaged, chest up

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Initiate by pushing hips back (like sitting in a chair)

**Step 2:** Bend knees and lower body

**Step 3:** Keep chest up and eyes forward

**Step 4:** Knees track over toes (in same direction)

**Step 5:** Lower until thighs are parallel to floor (or as deep as comfortable)

**Step 6:** Push through heels to stand

**Step 7:** Squeeze glutes at top

### Key Points

- Weight stays in heels/mid-foot (not toes)
- Knees don't cave inward
- Back stays neutral (no excessive rounding or arching)
- Heels stay on floor

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Quads working (front of thighs)
- Glutes firing (especially on the way up)
- Core engaged throughout
- Stretch in hips at bottom

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Knee pain
- Lower back pain
- Heels lifting off floor
- Unable to maintain form

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Knees Caving In

**What happens:** Knees collapse inward during squat
**Why it's wrong:** Stresses knees, indicates weak hips
**Fix:** Actively push knees out; strengthen hip abductors

### Mistake 2: Heels Rising

**What happens:** Weight shifts to toes, heels lift
**Why it's wrong:** Puts more stress on knees; indicates mobility issue
**Fix:** Work on ankle mobility; widen stance; use heel elevation temporarily

### Mistake 3: Excessive Forward Lean

**What happens:** Torso tips far forward
**Why it's wrong:** Shifts load to lower back
**Fix:** Keep chest up; work on hip and ankle mobility; strengthen core

### Mistake 4: Rounding Lower Back ("Butt Wink")

**What happens:** Lower back rounds at bottom of squat
**Why it's wrong:** Can stress lumbar spine under load
**Fix:** Limit depth to where you maintain neutral spine; work on hip mobility

### Mistake 5: Not Going Deep Enough

**What happens:** Partial squats only
**Why it's wrong:** Limits muscle development and mobility
**Fix:** Work on mobility; use appropriate depth for your current ability

## Squat Variations

### Goblet Squat

Hold a weight at chest level.

1. Hold dumbbell or kettlebell at chest
2. Elbows pointing down
3. Squat with same form
4. Weight helps counterbalance
5. Great for learning depth and form

### Wall Squat (Isometric)

Hold position against wall.

1. Back flat against wall
2. Slide down until thighs parallel to floor
3. Hold for time
4. Builds endurance
5. Good for knee rehab or beginners

### Box Squat

Squat to a box or bench.

1. Set box behind you
2. Squat until you touch box
3. Pause briefly
4. Stand back up
5. Provides depth reference; builds confidence

### Sumo Squat

Wider stance, toes out more.

1. Feet wider than shoulder width
2. Toes pointed out 45 degrees
3. Squat straight down
4. Emphasizes inner thighs and glutes
5. Can be easier for those with mobility limitations

### Split Squat

Single-leg emphasis.

1. Feet staggered front and back
2. Lower straight down
3. Front leg does most of work
4. Great for addressing imbalances
5. Bridge between squat and lunge

## Programming

### For Beginners

- **Variation:** Bodyweight squat or box squat
- **Sets:** 2-3
- **Reps:** 10-12
- **Frequency:** 2x per week
- **Focus:** Depth and form before adding load

### For Building Strength

- **Variation:** Goblet squat or barbell squat
- **Sets:** 3-4
- **Reps:** 8-12
- **Weight:** Challenging but maintainable form
- **Frequency:** 2x per week

### For Mobility

- **Variation:** Deep squat hold
- **Duration:** 30-60 seconds
- **Focus:** Relax into bottom position
- **Frequency:** Daily

## Mobility Work for Better Squats

### Ankle Mobility

Limited ankle flexibility is common and causes heel rise.

**Test:** Knee-to-wall test
**Fix:** Ankle mobility stretches, heel elevated squats

### Hip Mobility

Tight hips limit depth and cause compensation.

**Test:** Can you sit in deep squat position?
**Fix:** Hip flexor stretches, 90-90 stretch, deep squat holds

### Thoracic Mobility

Stiff upper back makes it hard to stay upright.

**Test:** Can you keep chest up throughout?
**Fix:** Thoracic extension exercises, cat-cow

## Special Considerations for Women

### During Pregnancy

- Squats are generally safe throughout pregnancy
- May need to widen stance as belly grows
- Don't hold breath (avoid Valsalva)
- Can help prepare for labor
- Reduce weight; focus on movement quality

### With Pelvic Floor Concerns

- Squats can help strengthen pelvic floor
- Exhale on the way up (don't hold breath)
- Don't push down/bear down at bottom
- Work with pelvic floor PT if issues exist

### Bone Density

- Squats are weight-bearing and build bone
- Especially important during perimenopause and beyond
- Progress gradually with weight

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are squats bad for your knees?

No, when done correctly. Squats can actually help knee health by strengthening surrounding muscles. Pain usually indicates form issues or pre-existing conditions.

### How deep should I squat?

As deep as you can while maintaining good form (neutral spine, heels down). For most people, thighs parallel to floor is a good target. Some can go deeper; some need to stay higher.

### Should my knees go past my toes?

Some forward knee travel is normal and okay. The old "knees behind toes" rule is outdated. Focus on keeping heels down and knees tracking over toes.

### How often should I squat?

2-3 times per week allows for recovery and progress. Bodyweight squats can be done more frequently.
