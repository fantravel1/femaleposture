# Face Pulls: The Best Exercise for Rounded Shoulders

> **At a Glance:** Face pulls are one of the most effective exercises for correcting rounded shoulders. They strengthen the rear deltoids, rotator cuff, and upper back muscles that pull your shoulders back into proper alignment.

## Why Face Pulls Work

Most daily activities involve pushing and internal rotation:
- Typing
- Driving
- Carrying things
- Pushing doors

Face pulls do the opposite:
- Pulling motion
- External rotation
- Shoulder blade retraction
- Rear delt activation

This balances the anterior-dominant pattern that creates rounded shoulders.

## Step-by-Step Instructions (Resistance Band)

### Setup

1. Attach resistance band to sturdy anchor at face height
2. Hold one end in each hand
3. Step back until band is taut
4. Arms extended in front

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Stand tall, core engaged

**Step 2:** Pull band toward your face

**Step 3:** As you pull, separate hands and rotate arms outward

**Step 4:** At end position: elbows high, hands beside ears, band at forehead level

**Step 5:** Squeeze shoulder blades together

**Step 6:** Hold 1-2 seconds

**Step 7:** Return slowly with control

**Step 8:** Repeat

### Key Points

- Pull to face, not chest
- Elbows stay high
- External rotation is key (hands rotate outward)
- Shoulder blades squeeze at end

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Rear deltoids working (back of shoulders)
- Upper back muscles engaging
- Shoulder blades squeezing together
- External rotators activating

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Shoulder pinching
- Neck strain
- Sharp pain anywhere

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Pulling to Chest

**What happens:** Band comes to chest level instead of face
**Why it's wrong:** Becomes a row, not a face pull—different muscles
**Fix:** Pull toward forehead/eye level

### Mistake 2: Elbows Dropping

**What happens:** Elbows drop below shoulder level
**Why it's wrong:** Reduces rear delt and rotator cuff activation
**Fix:** Keep elbows high throughout

### Mistake 3: No External Rotation

**What happens:** Just pulling straight back
**Why it's wrong:** Misses the rotator cuff benefit
**Fix:** Actively rotate arms outward as you pull

### Mistake 4: Using Too Much Weight

**What happens:** Body swings, form breaks down
**Why it's wrong:** Loses the targeted benefit
**Fix:** Use light resistance with perfect form

## Variations

### Band Face Pull (At Home)

Best option for home:
1. Loop band around pole, door anchor, or sturdy object
2. Face height anchor point
3. Perform as described above

### Cable Face Pull (Gym)

At a cable machine:
1. Set cable at face height
2. Use rope attachment
3. Same movement pattern
4. Allows precise weight selection

### Seated Face Pull

- Sit on floor or bench
- Reduces body momentum
- Stricter form

### High-to-Low Face Pull

- Anchor above head height
- Pull down and toward face
- Different angle, same benefits

---

## Programming

### For Beginners

- **Sets:** 2-3
- **Reps:** 15-20 (light resistance)
- **Frequency:** 3 times per week
- **Focus:** Perfect form before adding resistance

### For Strength

- **Sets:** 3-4
- **Reps:** 12-15
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times per week
- **Progress:** Gradually increase resistance

### In a Routine

**Best paired with:**
- Pushing exercises (balance the push with pull)
- Chest stretches
- Upper body workouts

**Sample balanced workout:**
1. Push-ups or chest press
2. **Face pulls (15 reps)**
3. Rows
4. Doorway stretch

## Why Women Should Prioritize Face Pulls

Many women avoid upper body pulling exercises, leading to:
- Weak rear deltoids
- Underactive rotator cuff
- Rounded shoulders
- Increased shoulder injury risk

Face pulls are:
- Light load, low intimidation
- Can be done at home with band
- Highly effective for posture
- Protective for shoulder health

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do face pulls?

3-4 times per week is ideal. They're a light enough exercise that daily performance won't cause overtraining if volume is reasonable.

### Can I do face pulls every day?

Yes, if keeping volume moderate (2 sets of 15). Many people benefit from daily face pulls to counteract daily pushing patterns.

### What resistance band should I use?

Start lighter than you think. A light or medium band is usually appropriate. You should complete 15-20 reps with good form.

### Are face pulls better than rows?

Different exercises, both valuable. Rows are more general pulling strength. Face pulls specifically target posture muscles and external rotation. Ideally, do both.
