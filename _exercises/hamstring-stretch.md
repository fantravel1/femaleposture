## Why Hamstring Flexibility Matters

Your hamstrings connect your pelvis to your knee. When they're tight:
- They can pull your pelvis into posterior tilt
- Lower back may compensate
- Forward bending is limited
- Walking and running mechanics are affected
- Sitting can feel uncomfortable

However, note that "tight" hamstrings sometimes aren't actually short—they may feel tight because they're weak or because the pelvis is tilted. Stretching helps, but so does strengthening.

## Standing Hamstring Stretch

The simplest stretch you can do anywhere.

### How to Do It

1. Stand facing a step, chair, or low table
2. Place one heel on the surface, leg straight
3. Keep standing leg slightly bent
4. Hinge forward at hips, keeping back flat
5. Feel stretch in back of raised thigh
6. Hold 30-60 seconds
7. Switch sides

### Key Points

- Don't round your back to reach further
- Keep hips square (facing forward)
- Height of surface matters—lower is less intense
- Flexing foot (toes toward shin) increases stretch

## Supine Hamstring Stretch

Lying down provides back support and more control.

### With Strap/Towel

1. Lie on back
2. Wrap strap or towel around ball of one foot
3. Extend that leg toward ceiling
4. Keep other leg bent or straight on floor
5. Gently pull strap to deepen stretch
6. Keep leg straight but knee soft
7. Hold 30-60 seconds
8. Switch sides

### Without Props

1. Lie on back
2. Lift one leg toward ceiling
3. Hold behind thigh or calf
4. Gently pull leg toward you
5. Keep knee straight (or slight bend)
6. Hold 30-60 seconds
7. Switch sides

## Seated Hamstring Stretch

Classic stretch for flexibility work.

### Both Legs

1. Sit on floor, legs extended straight
2. Sit tall on sitting bones
3. Hinge forward from hips
4. Reach toward feet (or as far as comfortable)
5. Keep back flat as long as possible
6. Hold 30-60 seconds

### One Leg at a Time

1. Sit with one leg extended, other bent (sole to inner thigh)
2. Turn torso to face extended leg
3. Hinge forward from hips
4. Reach toward foot
5. Hold 30-60 seconds
6. Switch sides

### Key Points

- Don't round back to reach further—go less far with flat back
- Feel should be in hamstring, not lower back
- Flexing foot increases stretch

## Doorway Hamstring Stretch

Uses gravity for a passive stretch.

### How to Do It

1. Lie on back in a doorway
2. Extend one leg up the door frame
3. Other leg through the doorway, flat on floor (or bent)
4. Scoot closer to door frame to increase stretch
5. Relax and let gravity do the work
6. Hold 1-3 minutes
7. Switch sides

### Why It Works

- Very relaxing—no active holding
- Gravity provides consistent stretch
- Can stay in position longer
- Good for very tight hamstrings

---

## Forward Fold (Standing)

Full hamstring and back release.

### How to Do It

1. Stand with feet hip-width apart
2. Hinge at hips, bending forward
3. Let arms hang toward floor
4. Knees can be bent as needed
5. Let head and neck relax
6. Hold 30-60 seconds
7. Roll up slowly to standing

### Modifications

- Bend knees to reduce intensity
- Place hands on blocks or shins
- Cross arms and hold elbows
- For back issues, bend knees more

## Reclined Big Toe Pose (Supta Padangusthasana)

Yoga pose for hamstring flexibility.

### How to Do It

1. Lie on back
2. Extend left leg on floor
3. Draw right knee to chest
4. Loop strap around right foot
5. Extend right leg toward ceiling
6. Keep left leg and both hips grounded
7. Hold 1-2 minutes
8. Switch sides

### For More Stretch

- Gently pull leg toward you
- Keep both hips on ground (don't let opposite hip lift)

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Stretch sensation behind thigh
- Mild tension that eases with time
- Gradual increase in range of motion

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Sharp pain (especially behind knee)
- Tingling or numbness down leg
- Sciatica symptoms increasing
- Pain in lower back

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rounding the Back

**What happens:** Spine curves to reach further
**Why it's wrong:** Stretches back, not hamstrings; can strain spine
**Fix:** Keep back flat; go less far if needed

### Mistake 2: Locking the Knee

**What happens:** Hyperextending the knee joint
**Why it's wrong:** Stresses the joint
**Fix:** Keep a micro-bend in the knee

### Mistake 3: Bouncing

**What happens:** Pulsing in and out of stretch
**Why it's wrong:** Can cause muscle strain; less effective
**Fix:** Hold steady stretch; breathe deeply

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Pain

**What happens:** Pushing through discomfort
**Why it's wrong:** Can injure muscles
**Fix:** Stretch should feel like stretch, not pain

## Programming

### Daily Stretching

- Choose 1-2 variations
- Hold each 30-60 seconds per side
- Do after sitting or exercise
- Consistency is key

### Pre-Workout

- Shorter holds (15-30 seconds)
- Don't overstretch before activity
- Dynamic stretching may be better

### Post-Workout

- Longer holds (45-90 seconds)
- Muscles warm and more pliable
- Good time for flexibility gains

### Yoga Practice

- Multiple hamstring poses throughout
- Hold 1-3 minutes in yin style
- Combine with hip and back work

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are my hamstrings always tight?

Common causes:
- Sitting for long periods
- Lack of regular stretching
- Weak glutes (hamstrings compensate)
- Pelvic tilt issues
- Running without stretching

### How long does it take to increase flexibility?

With consistent daily stretching:
- Some improvement in 2-4 weeks
- Noticeable change in 6-8 weeks
- Significant flexibility in 3-6 months

### Can I overstretch my hamstrings?

Yes. Signs of overstretching:
- Pain during or after
- Soreness that lasts days
- Feeling "unstable" in the muscle
- Bruising

Stretch to mild tension, not pain.

### Should I stretch if I have sciatica?

Depends on the cause. Hamstring stretching can help or worsen sciatica. If symptoms increase with stretching, stop and consult a professional.
