## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I hold?

Start with what you can manage with good form. Progress from 15 seconds toward 60+ seconds.

### Should my lower back touch the wall?

Yes—flatten lower back gently against wall for neutral spine practice.

### Why do my thighs shake?

Muscle fatigue is normal. It means they're working. Stop if you can't maintain form.

### Can I do wall sits every day?

Your muscles need recovery. 2-3 times per week is enough for most people.

### What if my knees hurt?

Don't go as deep. If pain persists at any depth, consult a professional.
