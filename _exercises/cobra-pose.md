## Why Cobra Pose Helps Posture

Modern life has us bent forward constantly:
- Sitting at desks
- Looking at phones
- Driving
- Cooking, cleaning, caring for others

Cobra pose reverses this by:
- Extending the spine backward
- Opening the chest muscles
- Strengthening back extensors
- Creating length through the front body

## How to Do Cobra Pose

### Starting Position

1. Lie face down on mat
2. Legs extended, tops of feet on floor
3. Palms on floor beside shoulders
4. Elbows close to body
5. Forehead resting on mat

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Press tops of feet and thighs into floor

**Step 2:** On an inhale, begin to lift head and chest

**Step 3:** Use back muscles (not just arms) to lift

**Step 4:** Keep elbows slightly bent, hugging toward body

**Step 5:** Lift only as high as comfortable—this is gentle

**Step 6:** Draw shoulders back and down (away from ears)

**Step 7:** Hold for 3-5 breaths

**Step 8:** Lower slowly on exhale

**Step 9:** Rest and repeat 2-3 times

### Key Points

- Keep glutes relaxed (don't squeeze buttocks)
- Don't push with arms to lift higher than back allows
- Keep neck long, gaze slightly forward and down
- Low back should not feel compressed

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Stretch across chest and front of shoulders
- Back muscles engaging to lift
- Gentle extension through spine
- Opening through front body

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Sharp pain in lower back
- Pinching sensation in spine
- Numbness or tingling
- Pain that worsens with the pose

## Variations

### Baby Cobra

For beginners or sensitive backs:
1. Lift only a few inches
2. Arms can stay on floor
3. Very gentle extension
4. Focus on engagement, not height

### Low Cobra

Standard version:
1. Lift to a moderate height
2. Elbows bent, close to body
3. Shoulders back and down
4. This is what most people should do

### High Cobra

More extension (not for beginners):
1. Arms more extended (not fully straight)
2. Higher lift through chest
3. Only if low back feels comfortable
4. Be careful not to compress spine

### Sphinx Pose (Related)

Even gentler alternative:
1. Forearms on floor, elbows under shoulders
2. Hold position
3. Very sustainable extension
4. Good for longer holds (1-3 minutes)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Shrugging Shoulders

**What happens:** Shoulders lift toward ears
**Why it's wrong:** Creates tension; loses chest opening
**Fix:** Actively draw shoulders down and back

### Mistake 2: Crunching Lower Back

**What happens:** Overextending in lumbar spine
**Why it's wrong:** Can cause pain; misses upper back benefit
**Fix:** Think of lengthening spine, not bending back

### Mistake 3: Squeezing Buttocks Hard

**What happens:** Glutes grip tightly
**Why it's wrong:** Compresses lower back
**Fix:** Keep glutes soft; let back muscles do the work

### Mistake 4: Pushing Up Too High

**What happens:** Using arm strength to force position
**Why it's wrong:** Bypasses back strengthening; strains low back
**Fix:** Only go as high as your back muscles can lift you

### Mistake 5: Holding Breath

**What happens:** Breath stops during pose
**Why it's wrong:** Creates tension; reduces benefit
**Fix:** Breathe smoothly throughout

## Cobra vs. Upward Dog

People often confuse these:

### Cobra Pose

- Legs on floor
- Thighs on floor
- Elbows bent
- Gentler back extension
- Best for beginners and daily practice

### Upward Facing Dog

- Only hands and tops of feet touch floor
- Thighs lifted off floor
- Arms straight
- Deeper back extension
- More advanced; more demanding

For posture improvement, cobra is usually better and safer.

## Precautions

### Who Should Be Careful

- Pregnant women (after first trimester, avoid prone positions)
- Those with herniated discs (may worsen some herniations)
- Recent back injury or surgery
- Significant lower back pain

### Modifications for These Cases

- Use sphinx pose instead (gentler)
- Consult provider before practicing
- Keep extension very minimal
- Consider alternative chest openers

---

## Complementary Poses

**Before cobra:**
- Cat-cow (warms spine)
- Child's pose (gentle preparation)

**After cobra:**
- Child's pose (counter-stretch)
- Knees to chest (releases low back)
- Cat stretch (rounds spine)

**In a sequence:**
Warm up → Cobra (3x) → Child's pose → Cat-cow → Cobra hold → Child's pose

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How high should I lift in cobra?

Only as high as your back muscles can lift you without arm pushing. For most people doing this for posture, a few inches is plenty. Height isn't the goal.

### Is cobra safe for lower back pain?

It depends. Gentle extension helps some back pain and worsens others. Start very small. If it feels good or neutral, continue. If it increases pain, stop.

### How long should I hold cobra pose?

3-5 breaths for dynamic practice, up to 30 seconds for holds. Sphinx pose can be held longer (1-3 minutes).

### Can I do cobra if I'm pregnant?

In the first trimester, yes. After that, lying on your belly becomes uncomfortable and inadvisable. Switch to modified positions (seated chest openers, cat-cow).
