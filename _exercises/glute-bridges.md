# Glute Bridges: Complete Guide for Pelvic Alignment

> **At a Glance:** Glute bridges are a foundational exercise that strengthens the gluteus maximus while teaching proper pelvic control. Essential for correcting anterior pelvic tilt, supporting lower back health, and building posterior chain strength. Safe for most people including during pregnancy and postpartum.

## Why This Exercise Works

Many women have weak, inhibited glutes from:
- Prolonged sitting
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Over-reliance on lower back and hip flexors

Glute bridges:
- Activate the gluteus maximus in a safe, controlled way
- Teach posterior pelvic tilt (counteracts anterior tilt)
- Strengthen the hip extension pattern
- Support the lower back by building posterior chain strength
- Are accessible for nearly all fitness levels

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back on a comfortable surface
2. Bend knees to about 90 degrees
3. Place feet flat on floor, hip-width apart
4. Arms at sides, palms down
5. Neutral spine (natural small curve in lower back)

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Gently engage your core (think of bracing as if someone were about to tickle you)

**Step 2:** Squeeze your glutes—feel them activate before you move

**Step 3:** Press through your heels and lift your hips toward ceiling

**Step 4:** Lift until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees

**Step 5:** Don't overarch—stop when body is straight (not hyperextended)

**Step 6:** Squeeze glutes at the top for 2-3 seconds

**Step 7:** Lower slowly and controlled back to start

**Step 8:** Repeat

### Breathing

- **Inhale:** At starting position
- **Exhale:** As you lift hips
- **Inhale:** At the top
- **Exhale:** As you lower

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Primary work in glutes (buttocks)
- Some hamstring engagement
- Core staying stable
- No strain in lower back

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Lower back doing most of the work
- Cramping in hamstrings
- Knee pain
- Lower back pain

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Lifting with Lower Back, Not Glutes

**What it looks like:** Lower back arches; hips don't come up as high
**Why it's wrong:** Misses the point; can strain lower back
**How to fix:** Squeeze glutes BEFORE lifting; focus on pushing hips to ceiling

### Mistake 2: Hyperextending at the Top

**What it looks like:** Over-arching lower back at top of movement
**Why it's wrong:** Strains lower back; doesn't work glutes fully
**How to fix:** Stop when shoulders-hips-knees form straight line

### Mistake 3: Pushing Through Toes

**What it looks like:** Heels lifting, weight on toes
**Why it's wrong:** Shifts work to quads instead of glutes
**How to fix:** Consciously press through heels; can even lift toes slightly

### Mistake 4: Feet Too Close or Too Far

**What it looks like:** Heels touching glutes OR legs almost straight
**Why it's wrong:** Changes muscle emphasis; may cause cramping
**How to fix:** Roughly 90-degree knee angle; adjust for comfort

### Mistake 5: Rushing Through Reps

**What it looks like:** Bouncing up and down quickly
**Why it's wrong:** Misses the squeeze; uses momentum
**How to fix:** 2-3 second lift, 2-3 second hold, 2-3 second lower

## Modifications and Variations

### Making It Easier

**Partial Range:**
- Don't lift as high
- Focus on squeezing glutes
- Gradually increase range

**Foot Position:**
- Move feet closer to glutes
- This often helps engage glutes better

### Making It Harder

**Single-Leg Bridge:**
1. Start in bridge position
2. Extend one leg straight (parallel to other thigh)
3. Perform bridge on single leg
4. Significantly harder—build up to this

**Elevated Bridge:**
1. Place feet on step, box, or couch
2. Increases range of motion
3. Greater glute challenge

**Banded Bridge:**
1. Place resistance band around thighs (above knees)
2. Push knees out against band throughout movement
3. Adds abductor work

**Marching Bridge:**
1. Lift to bridge position and hold
2. Alternately lift each foot slightly off floor
3. Keep hips level—no dropping
4. Core stability challenge

**Weighted Bridge:**
1. Place dumbbell, barbell, or weight plate on hips
2. Hold weight steady
3. Perform standard bridge

## Programming

### For Beginners / Postpartum

- **Sets:** 2-3
- **Reps:** 10-15
- **Hold:** 2-3 seconds at top
- **Frequency:** Daily

### For Building Strength

- **Sets:** 3-4
- **Reps:** 12-15
- **Add:** Resistance (band or weight)
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times per week

### In a Routine

**Best paired with:**
- Hip flexor stretches (before or after)
- Clamshells
- Dead bugs
- Bird dogs

**Sample glute activation sequence:**
1. Hip flexor stretch (30 sec each side)
2. Clamshells (15 each side)
3. **Glute bridges (15 reps)**
4. Fire hydrants (10 each side)

## Special Considerations

### During Pregnancy

**First trimester:** Standard bridges are fine

**Second/third trimester:**
- Avoid lying flat on back for extended periods
- Options:
  - Prop upper body on pillows (inclined position)
  - Do fewer reps at a time
  - Switch to standing hip extension exercises

### Postpartum

- Glute bridges are one of the first core exercises recommended
- Start around 2 weeks postpartum (with clearance)
- Begin with small range of motion
- Focus on pelvic floor connection: exhale and engage pelvic floor as you lift
- Progress gradually

### With Lower Back Pain

Glute bridges are usually beneficial for lower back pain, but:
- Start with smaller range of motion
- Ensure glutes are doing the work, not lower back
- Stop if pain increases
- If pain persists, consult a provider

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I feel it in my hamstrings instead of glutes?

Common issue. Try:
- Moving feet closer to glutes
- Actively squeezing glutes before lifting
- Pressing through heels (not toes)
- Going slower with more intentional squeeze

### How often should I do glute bridges?

Daily is fine for bodyweight bridges. If using significant resistance, allow rest days.

### Can glute bridges replace squats?

They're complementary, not replacements. Glute bridges isolate glutes; squats are a compound movement. Both have value.

### Will glute bridges make my butt bigger?

Bodyweight bridges primarily build muscular endurance and activation. For muscle growth, you'd need progressive resistance.
