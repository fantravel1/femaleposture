## Why Quad Stretching Helps Posture

Tight quadriceps (especially rectus femoris):
- Pull pelvis into anterior tilt
- Limit hip extension
- Contribute to lower back strain
- Develop from prolonged sitting
- Affect running and walking mechanics

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Knee pain
- Lower back pain
- Sharp pain
- Cramping

---

## Quad Stretch vs. Hip Flexor Stretch

### Overlap

- Rectus femoris is both a quad and hip flexor
- These stretches complement each other
- Some positions stretch both

### Differences

- **Quad stretch:** Knee bent, emphasizes knee-crossing portion
- **Hip flexor stretch:** Emphasizes hip position

**Best approach:** Do both if you have tight anterior thighs/hips.

## When to Stretch Quads

### Daily Use

- After sitting
- After exercise
- Morning routine
- Before bed

### Especially After

- Running
- Cycling
- Squats and lunges
- Any quad-dominant exercise
- Prolonged sitting

---

## Programming

### Quick Stretch

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Arching Lower Back

**Problem:** Compensates instead of stretching
**Fix:** Tuck pelvis, engage core

### 2. Knee Flaring Out

**Problem:** Changes stretch angle
**Fix:** Keep knees together

### 3. Leaning Forward

**Problem:** Reduces stretch
**Fix:** Stand tall

### 4. Forcing Too Deep

**Problem:** Risk of strain
**Fix:** Gentle, progressive stretch

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I hold the stretch?

30-60 seconds is ideal. Longer for very tight areas.

### Should I stretch before or after running?

Light dynamic stretching before, static stretching after.

### One side is tighter—is that normal?

Yes, asymmetry is common. You may spend extra time on the tight side.

### My knee hurts when I bend it that far—what should I do?

Don't force range. Use a gentler version (lying down) or consult a professional if knee issues persist.
