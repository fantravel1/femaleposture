# Rows: Essential Back Strengthening Exercise

> **At a Glance:** Rows are fundamental for building a strong back that can hold you upright all day. They counteract the forward-pulling forces of desk work, phone use, and daily life.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, middle traps, rear deltoids, biceps |
| **Best For** | Rounded shoulders, weak back, posture strength |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner to Intermediate |
| **Equipment** | Dumbbells, resistance band, or cable machine |
| **Time** | 5-10 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 2-3 times per week |

## Why Rows Matter for Posture

Modern life is push-dominant:
- Typing pushes forward
- Driving pushes forward
- Carrying things in front
- Phone use pulls head forward

Rows counterbalance this by:
- Strengthening pulling muscles
- Training shoulder blade retraction
- Building back endurance
- Supporting upright posture

## Dumbbell Row (Single-Arm)

The most accessible row variation.

### Setup

1. Place left hand and left knee on bench (or sturdy surface)
2. Right foot on floor, slightly back
3. Right hand holds dumbbell, arm hanging straight
4. Back flat, parallel to floor
5. Head neutral

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Engage core to keep back flat

**Step 2:** Pull dumbbell toward hip/lower rib cage

**Step 3:** Lead with elbow, not hand

**Step 4:** Squeeze shoulder blade toward spine at top

**Step 5:** Lower with control

**Step 6:** Complete all reps, switch sides

### Key Points

- Pull to hip, not shoulder
- Elbow stays close to body
- No rotation through torso
- Full range of motion

---

## Resistance Band Row

Perfect for home or travel.

### Setup

1. Anchor band at chest height (door anchor, pole, etc.)
2. Hold handles or band ends
3. Step back until band is taut
4. Arms extended forward

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Stand tall, slight knee bend

**Step 2:** Pull handles toward lower chest/upper belly

**Step 3:** Squeeze shoulder blades together

**Step 4:** Hold briefly at end

**Step 5:** Return with control

### Variations

**Seated band row:** Sit on floor, band around feet
**High row:** Anchor higher, pull to upper chest
**Low row:** Anchor lower, pull to belly

---

## Bent-Over Barbell/Dumbbell Row

More advanced, requires good hip hinge.

### Setup

1. Hold weights with both hands
2. Hinge at hips until torso near parallel to floor
3. Slight knee bend
4. Arms hanging straight
5. Back flat, core engaged

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Pull weights toward lower chest

**Step 2:** Squeeze shoulder blades together

**Step 3:** Lower with control

**Step 4:** Maintain flat back throughout

### Caution

This variation requires solid hip hinge mechanics. Master single-arm row first.

---

## Cable Row (Seated)

Gym exercise with constant tension.

### Setup

1. Sit at cable machine, feet on platform
2. Knees slightly bent
3. Grab handle with both hands
4. Arms extended, slight lean forward

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Sit tall, slight chest lift

**Step 2:** Pull handle toward belly button

**Step 3:** Squeeze shoulder blades together

**Step 4:** Return with control, slight forward lean

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Upper and mid back muscles working
- Shoulder blades squeezing together

- Biceps working (secondary)

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Lower back pain
- Shoulder impingement/pinching
- Neck strain

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Shrugging Shoulders

**What happens:** Shoulders rise toward ears
**Why it's wrong:** Uses upper traps instead of target muscles
**Fix:** Actively pull shoulders down before rowing

### Mistake 2: Using Momentum

**What happens:** Swinging body to move weight
**Why it's wrong:** Reduces muscle work, risks injury
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movement; reduce weight if needed

### Mistake 3: Rounding Back

**What happens:** Upper back rounds during movement
**Why it's wrong:** Puts spine at risk, reduces effectiveness
**Fix:** Keep chest up, back flat

### Mistake 4: Short Range of Motion

**What happens:** Not fully extending or fully contracting
**Why it's wrong:** Misses full muscle development
**Fix:** Full extension at bottom, full squeeze at top

### Mistake 5: Pulling Too High

**What happens:** Pulling to shoulders instead of ribs/belly
**Why it's wrong:** Changes target muscles, can stress shoulder
**Fix:** Pull to lower chest or upper belly

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do rows?

2-3 times per week with at least one day between sessions for the same muscle group.

### What weight should I start with?

Start light—you should be able to do 12-15 reps with good form. Increase gradually.

### Are rows better than lat pulldowns?

Both are valuable. Rows emphasize horizontal pulling (retraction), while pulldowns emphasize vertical pulling. For posture, rows are often more important.

### Can I do rows every day?

Not recommended. Muscles need recovery. 2-3 times per week is sufficient.
