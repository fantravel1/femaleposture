## Why Calf Strength Matters for Posture

Your calves:
- Support you when standing
- Contribute to balance
- Affect how you walk
- Influence ankle mobility
- Are part of the posterior chain

Weak calves can contribute to:
- Poor balance
- Ankle instability
- Compensation elsewhere
- Fatigue with standing

## How to Do Basic Calf Raises

### Standing Calf Raises

**Starting Position:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart
2. Near wall or chair for balance if needed
3. Stand tall with good posture

**The Movement:**
1. Rise up onto balls of feet
2. Lift heels as high as possible
3. Hold at top briefly
4. Lower with control
5. Repeat 15-20 times

### Key Points

- Full range of motion
- Controlled movement
- Don't rush
- Even weight on both feet
- Keep core engaged

## Variations

### Single-Leg Calf Raises

**More challenging:**
1. Stand on one foot
2. Perform calf raise
3. Use support for balance
4. 10-15 reps each leg

### Seated Calf Raises

**For soleus muscle:**
1. Sit with feet flat
2. Raise heels while seated
3. Can add weight on thighs
4. 15-20 reps

### Eccentric Calf Raises

**For tendon health:**
1. Rise on both feet
2. Lower on one foot (slowly, 3-5 seconds)
3. Important for Achilles issues
4. 10-15 reps each leg

### Calf Raises on Step

**Full range:**
1. Stand with balls of feet on step
2. Heels hanging off edge
3. Lower below step level
4. Rise to full height

**Problem:** Shifts emphasis away from calves
**Fix:** Stay upright
