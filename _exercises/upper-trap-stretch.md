## Why the Upper Trap Gets Tight

The upper trapezius is a "stress muscle." It:
- Elevates (shrugs) the shoulders
- Assists with neck movement
- Holds tension from stress and poor posture

Common causes of tightness:
- Holding phone between ear and shoulder
- Stress (shoulders creep up unconsciously)
- Forward head posture
- Desk work (shoulders hunched)
- Carrying bags on shoulder

---

## The Basic Stretch

### Seated or Standing

**Step 1:** Sit or stand tall

**Step 2:** Drop your right shoulder down (or anchor by gripping chair bottom)

**Step 3:** Tilt your head left (left ear toward left shoulder)

**Step 4:** Feel the stretch along the right side of your neck/shoulder

**Step 5:** Hold for 30-60 seconds

**Step 6:** Breathe deeply and relax into the stretch

**Step 7:** Switch sides

### Key Points

- Keep looking forward (don't rotate head)
- Drop the shoulder you're stretching
- Don't force—gentle tension is enough
- Breathe through it

---

## Variations

### With Hand Assistance

1. Perform basic stretch
2. Place opposite hand on head (gently)
3. Add light overpressure
4. Don't pull—just gentle weight

### Rotating the Head

Changing head rotation changes which fibers are stretched:

**Look up and away:** Stretches back fibers
**Look down and toward:** Stretches front fibers
**Look straight across:** Stretches middle fibers

Try all three to find what feels tightest.

### Against the Wall

1. Stand with side to wall
2. Hand of stretch side flat on wall behind you, slightly below shoulder
3. Tilt head away from wall
4. The wall helps anchor the shoulder down

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Hiking the Shoulder

**What happens:** Shoulder creeps up during stretch
**Why it's wrong:** Reduces the stretch
**Fix:** Consciously drop shoulder; grip chair for anchor

### Mistake 2: Holding Breath

**What happens:** Tension throughout body
**Why it's wrong:** Limits relaxation
**Fix:** Breathe slowly and deeply throughout

### Mistake 3: Pulling Too Hard

**What happens:** Aggressive pressure on head
**Why it's wrong:** Can strain muscles or neck
**Fix:** Gentle pressure only; let gravity and time do the work

### Mistake 4: Too Short a Hold

**What happens:** 5-10 second holds
**Why it's wrong:** Not long enough for real tissue release
**Fix:** 30-60 seconds minimum; 2 minutes for significant tightness

## Programming

### For Daily Relief

- **Duration:** 30-60 seconds each side
- **Frequency:** 3-5 times throughout day
- **When:** Whenever tension builds

### For Significant Tightness

- **Duration:** 60-90 seconds each side
- **Frequency:** Morning, midday, evening
- **Technique:** Include rotation variations

### Best Paired With

- Shoulder rolls

## When to Stretch Upper Traps

**Stretch immediately:**
- After being on the phone

- When you feel tension building

**Incorporate regularly:**
- Morning routine
- Desk breaks
- Before bed
- During workouts (after upper body work)

## Related Stretches

The neck has several muscles—you may also need:

**Levator Scapulae Stretch:**
- Look down toward armpit
- Hold back of head, pull gently down
- Different muscle, related tension

**Scalene Stretch:**
- Similar position to upper trap stretch
- Rotate head away before tilting
- Stretches side of neck

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does only one side feel tight?

Often related to habits (phone on one side, bag on one shoulder, turning one direction at desk). You may need to focus extra on the tight side.

### How often is too often?

You can't really stretch upper traps too often. Several times daily is fine—they can take it and often need it.

### Will stretching fix the problem?

Stretching provides relief but isn't the complete solution. Also address:
- Posture at desk
- Stress management
- Phone habits
- Strengthening weak muscles

### What if it doesn't feel like it's stretching?

Try the variations (rotation, wall-assisted). Make sure you're dropping the shoulder. Some days they're less tight.
