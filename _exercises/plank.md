## Why Planks Help Posture

Planks train your core to:
- Maintain spinal position
- Resist unwanted movement
- Support your spine during activity
- Work as a stabilizer, not a mover

This is exactly what your core does when you stand and sit with good posture.

## How to Do a Plank

### Forearm Plank (Standard)

1. Start on forearms and toes
2. Elbows directly under shoulders
3. Forearms parallel or hands clasped
4. Body in straight line from head to heels
5. Core engaged, glutes squeezed
6. Hold position

### Key Points

- **Head:** Neutral, looking at floor
- **Shoulders:** Down, not shrugged
- **Back:** Flat, no sagging or piking
- **Hips:** Level with shoulders
- **Glutes:** Engaged
- **Breathing:** Normal throughout

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Hips Sagging

**Problem:** Lower back drops toward floor
**Why it's wrong:** Stresses lower back, core not engaged
**Fix:** Squeeze glutes, tilt pelvis slightly under

### 2. Hips Too High

**Problem:** Butt in the air
**Why it's wrong:** Not working core effectively
**Fix:** Drop hips to straight line

### 3. Head Position Wrong

**Problem:** Looking up or tucking chin
**Why it's wrong:** Strains neck
**Fix:** Neutral neck, look at floor

### 4. Shoulders Shrugged

**Problem:** Shoulders up near ears
**Why it's wrong:** Creates neck tension
**Fix:** Press shoulder blades down and back

### 5. Holding Breath

**Problem:** Not breathing
**Why it's wrong:** Increases tension, unsustainable
**Fix:** Breathe normally throughout

## Programming Planks

### Building Time

**Week 1-2:**
- 3 sets of 10-20 seconds
- Rest 30-60 seconds between

**Week 3-4:**
- 3 sets of 20-30 seconds
- Focus on perfect form

**Week 5-8:**
- 3 sets of 30-45 seconds
- Add variations

**Long-term:**
- 45-60 second holds are sufficient
- Add difficulty rather than more time

### In Core Routine

- Include with side planks
- Pair with dynamic exercises (bird-dog, dead bug)
- 2-3 times per week

### For Posture Improvement

- Daily short planks (20-30 sec)
- Focus on core activation awareness
- Transfer feeling to standing posture

---

## Plank Variations for Posture

### Long-Lever Plank

- Arms extended further forward
- Increases core demand
- More challenging

### Body Saw

1. In forearm plank
2. Rock body forward and back
3. Maintain rigid core
4. Controlled movement

### Plank with Leg Lift

1. Hold plank position
2. Lift one leg slightly
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. Switch legs
5. Challenges stability

---

## How Long to Hold?

### Research Says

- After 30-60 seconds, benefits plateau
- Better to do multiple sets
- Quality over duration
- Add difficulty instead of time

### Practical Approach

- 30-60 seconds is plenty
- If you can hold 90+ seconds, make it harder
- Multiple shorter holds may be better than one long one

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are planks safe for lower back?

Generally yes, but:
- Start with easier variations
- Stop if you feel back pain
- Keep core engaged to protect spine
- Don't let hips sag

### How often should I plank?

3-5 times per week is effective. Daily is fine if not sore.

### High plank or forearm plank—which is better?

Both are valuable:
- Forearm plank: More core focus
- High plank: More arm/shoulder work
- Include both

### My wrists hurt in high plank—what should I do?

- Use forearm plank instead
- Try fists instead of flat hands
- Use push-up handles
- Check wrist mobility
