# Reverse Plank: Open Chest and Strengthen Posterior Chain

> **At a Glance:** Reverse plank is the opposite of regular plank—you face upward, opening the front body while strengthening the entire back side. Excellent for counteracting hunched desk posture.

| **Best For** | Rounded posture, chest tightness, posterior chain weakness |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Equipment** | Mat |
| **Time** | 2-3 minutes |
| **Frequency** | 3-4x per week |

## Why Reverse Plank Helps Posture

Most of our daily activities happen in front of us:
- Typing
- Driving
- Cooking
- Carrying
- Looking at screens

This creates tightness in the front and weakness in the back. Reverse plank directly addresses both by:
- Opening chest and front shoulders
- Strengthening glutes and hamstrings
- Engaging upper back
- Building shoulder stability
- Creating extension through the spine

## How to Do Reverse Plank

### Starting Position

1. Sit on floor with legs extended
2. Hands behind you, fingers pointing toward feet (or slightly outward)
3. Hands about shoulder-width apart
4. Feet together or hip-width apart

### The Movement

**Step 1:** Press hands and heels into floor

**Step 2:** Lift hips toward ceiling

**Step 3:** Create straight line from head to heels

**Step 4:** Squeeze glutes firmly

**Step 5:** Press chest toward ceiling

**Step 6:** Keep neck neutral (don't drop head back or tuck chin too much)

**Step 7:** Hold for 15-30 seconds

**Step 8:** Lower with control

**Step 9:** Rest and repeat 2-3 times

### Key Points

- Don't let hips sag
- Keep glutes engaged throughout
- Shoulders back and down (not shrugging)
- Breathe normally while holding

---

## What You Should Feel

### Good Sensations

- Glutes and hamstrings working hard
- Stretch across chest and front shoulders
- Upper back muscles engaging
- Triceps working
- Whole back body firing

### Red Flags—Stop If:

- Wrist pain
- Sharp shoulder pain
- Lower back pain
- Neck strain

## Modifications and Variations

### Beginner: Reverse Table Top

If full reverse plank is too challenging:
1. Start with knees bent, feet flat on floor
2. Hands behind you
3. Lift hips to create tabletop shape
4. Thighs parallel to floor
5. Much more accessible starting point

### Easier Reverse Plank

1. Keep knees slightly bent in full position
2. Reduces hamstring flexibility demands
3. Still works posterior chain
4. Build up to straight legs

### Fingers Pointing Out

1. If wrist flexibility is limited
2. Turn fingers to point sideways or slightly back
3. Reduces wrist extension demand
4. Still effective for body

### Single Leg Reverse Plank (Advanced)

1. In full reverse plank position
2. Lift one leg
3. Hold 5-10 seconds
4. Lower and switch
5. Adds significant challenge

### Reverse Plank with Leg Lifts

1. Hold reverse plank
2. Lift one leg a few inches
3. Lower and alternate
4. Works hip extensors more

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Hips Sagging

**What happens:** Hips drop, body bends in the middle
**Why it's wrong:** Loses core and glute benefit; strains lower back
**Fix:** Squeeze glutes harder; think of pushing hips up

### Mistake 2: Shoulders Shrugging

**What happens:** Shoulders rise toward ears
**Why it's wrong:** Creates neck tension; less chest opening
**Fix:** Actively press shoulders down and back

### Mistake 3: Head Dropping Back

**What happens:** Looking at ceiling, neck hyperextended
**Why it's wrong:** Strains neck
**Fix:** Keep head in line with spine; look forward or slightly up

### Mistake 4: Wrists at Wrong Angle

**What happens:** Too much pressure on wrists
**Why it's wrong:** Causes wrist pain
**Fix:** Experiment with finger direction; strengthen wrist gradually

### Mistake 5: Holding Breath

**What happens:** Not breathing during hold
**Why it's wrong:** Increases tension; reduces effectiveness
**Fix:** Breathe slowly and steadily throughout

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do my wrists hurt in reverse plank?

Wrist extension under load is demanding. Solutions: turn fingers outward, build wrist strength gradually, do wrist warm-ups, or use the tabletop variation.

### How long should I hold reverse plank?

Start with 15-20 seconds. Build to 30-45 seconds. Quality (maintaining form) matters more than time.

### Is reverse plank good for lower back pain?

It can be if done correctly, as it strengthens glutes and back. But if it causes pain, modify or skip it. Consult a professional if unsure.

### Can I do reverse plank every day?

Most people can, but 3-4x per week is sufficient for strength building. If muscles are very sore, allow recovery time.

### Should my head hang back?

No. Keep your head in line with your spine. Looking slightly up or forward is fine, but don't drop it back and strain your neck.
