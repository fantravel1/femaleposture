# Housework and Cleaning Posture: Save Your Back at Home

> **The Invisible Workout:** On average, women spend 2-3 times more hours on housework than men. That's a lot of bending, lifting, scrubbing, and reaching—often with terrible body mechanics. Housework is work, and your body deserves protection.

---

## The Hidden Physical Demands

### The Numbers

- Average weekly housework: 15-25 hours (women) vs 5-10 hours (men)
- Calories burned: 150-300 per hour depending on activity
- Common result: Lower back pain, shoulder strain, fatigue

### Why Housework Hurts

**Bending forward repeatedly:**
- Mopping, vacuuming, making beds
- Loading dishwasher, washing tub
- Picking up clutter

**Reaching and twisting:**
- Cleaning surfaces, dusting high places
- Loading/unloading laundry
- Scrubbing awkward spaces

**Sustained positions:**
- Ironing, hand-washing dishes
- Detailed cleaning tasks
- Food preparation

**Lifting and carrying:**
- Laundry baskets, groceries
- Moving furniture to clean
- Trash and recycling

## Task-by-Task Guide

### Vacuuming and Mopping

**The problem:** Most people hunch over and push/pull with their back

**Better approach:**
- Stand tall with vacuum or mop in front of you
- Use a lunge pattern—step forward as you push, step back as you pull
- Let your legs do the work, not your back
- Keep the tool close to your body
- Switch hands periodically
- Take breaks—don't do the whole house at once

**Equipment help:**
- Upright vacuums are generally better than canisters for back
- Lightweight options reduce strain
- Long-handled mops reduce bending
- Spray mops can be lighter than bucket and mop

### Making Beds

**The problem:** Bending over the bed, reaching across, tucking sheets

**Better approach:**
- Walk around the bed rather than reaching across
- Kneel beside the bed to tuck sheets
- Lift mattress by squatting, not bending
- Consider fitted sheets that are easier to manage
- Break the task into segments if large beds

### Laundry

**Loading/unloading washer:**
- Front-loaders: Squat or kneel, don't bend at waist
- Top-loaders: Step close, use legs to lean in
- Place laundry basket on raised surface

**Carrying laundry:**
- Hold basket close to body
- Or use a rolling hamper
- Make multiple trips if heavy

**Folding:**
- Raise folding surface to waist height
- Don't hunch over low surfaces
- Sit if doing a lot of folding

**Ironing:**
- Adjust board to elbow height
- Stand with one foot slightly forward
- Wear supportive shoes
- Take breaks every 15-20 minutes

### Kitchen Cleaning

**Dishes:**
- Stand close to sink
- If sink is too low, open cabinet below and put one foot inside on the shelf
- Alternate standing positions
- Fill dishwasher by squatting, not bending

**Counters and stovetop:**
- Stand parallel to surface
- Move feet rather than reaching
- Use long-handled brushes when possible

**Oven cleaning:**
- Kneel on one or both knees
- Use long-handled tools
- Take breaks
- Worst position for your back—do in short bursts

### Bathroom Cleaning

**Tub and shower:**
- Kneel beside tub on a pad
- Use long-handled scrub brushes
- Spray and wait (reduces scrubbing needed)
- Don't lean into the tub with rounded back

**Toilet:**
- Squat or kneel
- Quick task—just use proper form

**Floors:**
- Hands-and-knees scrubbing is hard on back
- Use mop instead when possible
- If scrubbing, kneel on one knee and switch

### Bed-Making and Room Tidying

**Picking up clutter:**
- Golfer's lift for single items (one leg goes back)
- Squat for multiple items
- Use a basket and pick up all at once
- Have children pick up their own things

**Dusting and wiping surfaces:**
- Work at eye level when possible
- Use long-handled dusters
- Move furniture rather than reaching behind it

## General Principles

### The Five Rules of Housework Posture

1. **Move your feet instead of reaching**
2. **Bend at hips and knees, not just the waist**
3. **Keep loads close to your body**
4. **Take breaks before you're exhausted**
5. **Use tools that reduce strain**

### Work at Appropriate Heights

- Kitchen counters: Elbow height for prep work
- Ironing board: Elbow height or slightly below
- Laundry folding: Waist height
- Scrubbing: Kneel rather than bend

### Break Up the Work

Instead of marathon cleaning sessions:
- 15-20 minute bursts with stretching between
- Different tasks use different muscles—rotate
- Don't save it all for one exhausting day
- Spread heavy tasks across the week

## Tools That Save Your Body

### Worth the Investment

- **Robotic vacuum:** Does the work for you
- **Lightweight upright vacuum:** Easier than dragging canister
- **Long-handled duster and scrub brushes:** Less bending
- **Spray mop:** Lighter than bucket and mop
- **Raised laundry pedestal:** Front-loader at better height
- **Rolling hamper/cart:** Don't carry heavy baskets
- **Kneeling pad:** Protects knees when you need to kneel

### Simple Fixes

- Keep cleaning supplies on each floor
- Use a bucket with wheels
- Choose concentrated cleaners (lighter bottles)
- Invest in ergonomic-handled tools

## Exercises for Housework Warriors

### Before Cleaning

**Quick warm-up (3 minutes):**
- Cat-cow: 10 cycles
- Hip circles: 10 each direction
- Shoulder rolls: 10 each direction
- Deep squats: 5 (if able)

### After Cleaning

**Recovery stretches (5 minutes):**

**Standing forward fold:**
- Hang with bent knees
- 30 seconds
- Releases lower back

**Chest opener in doorway:**
- 30 seconds each arm position
- Counteracts forward work

**Hip flexor stretch:**
- 30 seconds each side
- Counteracts kneeling and bending

**Seated twist:**
- 30 seconds each side
- Releases spine

### Weekly Maintenance

**Core strength:**
- Protects back during bending and lifting
- Planks, dead bugs, bird dogs
- 2-3 times per week

**Hip and glute strength:**
- Supports proper bending mechanics
- Squats, lunges, glute bridges
- 2-3 times per week

## Sharing the Load

### The Equity Issue

- Women do more housework even when working same hours
- This contributes to physical strain and less recovery time
- Fair distribution matters for health, not just principle

### Strategies

- Have a direct conversation about distribution
- Assign specific tasks
- Lower standards where possible (it doesn't have to be perfect)
- Consider outsourcing if budget allows
- Age-appropriate tasks for children (they live there too)

### When You Live Alone

- Prioritize tasks by necessity
- Batch similar activities
- Don't hold yourself to unrealistic standards
- Your health matters more than a spotless home

## When Housework Is Your Job

### Professional Cleaners

If you clean professionally:
- All the above applies, multiplied
- Proper training is essential
- Know your rights regarding breaks and equipment
- Pace yourself—this is a physically demanding job
- Prioritize your body over client expectations

### Caregiving Roles

If housework is combined with caregiving:
- Even more physically demanding
- See our [caregiver posture guide](/activities/caregiver-posture/)
- You need help—don't try to do it all alone
