# Shopping Posture Guide

> **Shopping Is Physical:** Walking stores, pushing carts, and carrying bags all challenge your body. Plan ahead to shop comfortably.

---

## In-Store Movement

### Walking the Store

**Footwear matters:**
- Wear supportive shoes
- Save heels for elsewhere
- Expect to walk 1-2+ miles in large stores

**Posture while browsing:**
- Don't hunch over cart
- Stand tall when looking at shelves
- Squat rather than bend for low items

### Reaching

**High shelves:**
- Ask for help
- Use available step stools
- Don't strain overhead with heavy items

**Low shelves:**
- Squat or kneel
- Don't repeatedly bend at waist
- One knee down for extended reaching

---

## Shopping Carts

### Pushing Technique

**Position:**
- Both hands on handle
- Stand upright
- Don't lean on cart
- Keep cart close

**Movement:**
- Push from your center
- Small steps
- Don't twist while pushing
- Use your legs for power

### Common Cart Mistakes

- Using cart as walker (leaning heavily)
- Pushing with one hand
- Hunching over handle
- Overloading cart

### Loading the Cart

- Heavy items at bottom
- Distribute weight evenly
- Don't overfill
- Think about unloading later

---

## Carrying Bags

### The One-Sided Problem

**Carrying on one side:**
- Shifts body weight
- Creates compensation
- Strains shoulder and back

### Better Carrying

**Balance the load:**
- Two bags, one per hand
- Even weight distribution
- Switch sides regularly

**Keep close:**
- Bags close to body
- Elbows bent
- Core engaged

**Duration:**
- Limit carrying distance
- Multiple trips if needed
- Use cart to car always

---

## Handbags and Purses

### The Weight Problem

Average purse: 5-7 lbs—sometimes much more

**Impact:**
- Shoulder elevation
- Spine curve
- Neck and shoulder pain

### Solutions

**Lighten it:**
- Clear out unnecessary items
- Carry only essentials today
- Weigh your purse—you'll be surprised

**Better bags:**
- Crossbody distributes weight
- Backpack for heavy loads
- Wide straps are gentler
- Switch sides regularly
