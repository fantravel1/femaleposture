# Photography Posture

Photography involves holding cameras, carrying equipment, and sometimes awkward shooting positions. Proper posture protects your body while capturing images.

- Neck neutral
- Core engaged
- Balanced stance

## Shooting Positions

### Standing

**Upright shooting:**
- Feet shoulder-width
- Knees soft
- Weight balanced
- Elbows tucked
- Stable base

### Low Angles

**Ground level:**

- Don't hunch over
- Alternative: lie down
- Careful rising

### Long Sessions

**Extended shooting:**

## Equipment Carrying

### Camera Bag

**Load management:**

- Lighten when possible
- Rolling option

### Strap Use

**Camera support:**

## Common Issues

Good photography posture lets you focus on your images without the back and neck pain that plagues many photographers.
