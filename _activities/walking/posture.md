- Chest open, not collapsed

**Common mistake:**

- Hunched upper back

### Core

**Correct:**
- Gentle engagement, not rigid
- Spine in natural curves
- Pelvis neutral

**Common mistake:**
- Completely relaxed core
- Excessive forward lean
- Anterior pelvic tilt

### Hips and Pelvis

**Correct:**
- Level pelvis
- Hips move naturally with gait
- Equal stride both sides

**Common mistake:**
- Tilted pelvis
- Excessive hip drop (Trendelenburg)
- Asymmetrical movement

### Legs and Feet

## How to Check Your Walking

### Mirror Method

Walk toward a full-length mirror:
- Watch your head position
- Notice shoulder symmetry
- Check if hips are level

### Video Method

Have someone film you walking:
- From the side (sagittal plane)
- From behind (frontal plane)
- Watch for asymmetries and posture issues

### Sound Method

Listen to your footsteps:
- Should be relatively quiet
- One foot heavier than other indicates asymmetry
- Stomping suggests poor control

### Problem 2: Rounded Shoulders

**What it looks like:** Shoulders curled forward
**Why it happens:** Tight chest, weak upper back
**How to fix:**
- Roll shoulders back and down before walking
- Strengthen upper back
- Think "proud chest" without overarching

### Problem 3: Excessive Sway (Hyperlordosis)

**What it looks like:** Big curve in lower back, belly forward
**Why it happens:** Weak core, tight hip flexors
**How to fix:**
- Gentle core engagement while walking
- Stretch hip flexors regularly
- Imagine tailbone pointing down

### Problem 4: Trendelenburg Gait

**What it looks like:** Hip drops on one side when stepping
**Why it happens:** Weak glutes on standing leg side
**How to fix:**
- Single-leg exercises
- Hip strengthening
- May need professional assessment

### Problem 5: Toe-Out Walking

**What it looks like:** Feet point outward like duck
**Why it happens:** Tight external hip rotators, habit
**How to fix:**

## Improving Your Walking Posture

### Pre-Walk Checklist

Before you start walking:
1. Stand tall
2. Roll shoulders back and down
3. Engage core gently
4. Level pelvis
5. Look forward

### While Walking

**Focus points:**
- Head over shoulders
- Shoulders relaxed
- Arms swinging naturally
- Core lightly engaged
- Feet pointing forward
- Smooth, quiet steps

### Cues That Help

- "Tall spine"
- "Eyes on horizon"
- "Proud but relaxed"
- "Glide, don't stomp"
- "Crown of head to the sky"

---

## Walking Speed and Posture

### Slow Walking

- Easier to maintain posture
- Good for learning new patterns
- Focus on each element

### Normal Pace

- Posture becomes more challenging
- Natural arm swing important
- Keep alignment cues in mind

### Fast Walking/Power Walking

- Core engagement more critical
- Arm swing increases
- Posture support must be automatic

---

## Walking Surfaces

### Flat Surfaces

- Easiest for good posture
- Practice here first
- Build habits

### Uphill

- Lean slightly forward from ankles (not waist)
- Shorten stride
- Engage glutes more

### Downhill

- Don't lean back excessively
- Control with legs
- Softened knees

### Uneven Terrain

- Requires more ankle and hip stability
- Slower pace
- Eyes alternate between horizon and ground

---

## Footwear and Walking

### Supportive Shoes

- Appropriate for your foot type
- Not excessively worn down
- Proper fit

### High Heels

- Shift center of gravity forward
- Increase lumbar curve
- Shorten stride
- Best worn minimally

### Minimalist Shoes

- Require foot strength
- Transition gradually
- Can improve natural gait (with proper transition)

## Exercise Connections

## Daily Practice

### The 100-Step Focus

During any walk:
1. Count 100 steps
2. Focus on one aspect of posture
3. Reset at intervals throughout walk

### Walking Meditation

Turn walking into mindful practice:
- Notice each foot placement
- Feel body alignment
- Breathe naturally
- Stay present

### Progress Tracking

- Take monthly walking videos
- Compare posture over time
- Notice what improves

---

## Special Considerations

### With Bags

**Backpack:** Best for symmetrical load
**Shoulder bag:** Alternate sides frequently
**Heavy bags:** Engage core, don't lean

### With Stroller

- Keep elbows bent
- Push from the chest, not just arms
- Stand tall, don't hunch over

### After Sitting
