# Meditation Posture Guide

> **Position Supports Practice:** The right meditation posture keeps you alert yet relaxed, allowing focus without physical distraction.

---

## Why Posture Matters in Meditation

### The Balance

**Meditation needs:**
- Alertness (not falling asleep)
- Relaxation (not tense)
- Stability (not wobbling)
- Sustainability (for the duration)

### Posture Does This

**Good position:**
- Supports wakefulness
- Allows relaxation
- Provides stable base
- Minimizes distraction

---

## The Core Principles

### Whatever Works

**No single "right" position:**
- Many traditions, many positions
- Your body matters
- Sustainability matters
- Not one-size-fits-all

### Aligned Spine

**Common element:**
- Spine naturally upright
- Not rigidly straight
- Not collapsed
- Balanced on sitting bones

### Relaxed Within Structure

**Alert yet easy:**
- Enough effort to stay upright
- No excess tension
- Shoulders soft
- Face and jaw relaxed

---

## Seated Options

### Cross-Legged on Floor

**Traditional approach:**
- Various leg arrangements
- Requires hip flexibility
- Cushion height important
- Not for everyone

**Making it work:**
- Height under sitting bones (cushion/bench)
- Knees below hips (or supported)
- Blankets under knees if needed
- Modify for your body

### Kneeling (Seiza)

**Position:**
- Knees bent, sitting on heels
- Or using meditation bench
- Spine upright
- Feet extended behind

**Support options:**
- Meditation bench (takes weight off feet)
- Cushion between heels and sit bones
- Padding under knees

### On a Chair

**Perfectly valid:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Sitting bones on seat edge or back support
- Spine naturally upright
- Not slouching back

**When to use:**
- Physical limitations
- Knee or hip issues
- Longer sessions
- Any time it's needed

---

## Floor Sitting Setup

### Cushion Height

**The key factor:**
- Hips above knees
- Allows pelvis to tilt slightly forward
- Spine naturally upright
- Height varies by person

**Finding right height:**
- Too low: back strains, legs uncomfortable
- Too high: unstable
- Experiment
- More is often needed than expected

### Cushion Types

**Options:**
- Zafu (round cushion)
- Zabuton (mat underneath)
- Meditation bench
- Folded blankets
- Bolster

### Leg Arrangements

**Options (least to most challenging):**
- Burmese (both legs in front, not crossed)
- Quarter lotus (one foot on opposite calf)
- Half lotus (one foot on opposite thigh)
- Full lotus (both feet on thighs—advanced)

---

## Chair Meditation

### Setup

**Position:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Not crossing legs
- Sitting toward front of chair (or back if using for support)
- Spine self-supported or light back contact

### Making It Work

**If using chair back:**
- Light contact, not collapsing into it
- Still mostly self-supporting
- Lumbar support if helpful

**If sitting forward:**
- Full spine self-support
- More engaging (for alertness)
- May be more challenging

---

## Lying Down

### When Appropriate

**May be needed:**
- Pain prevents sitting
- Injury or illness
- Certain practices (yoga nidra, body scans)
- Accessibility need

### The Challenge

**Tendency to:**
- Fall asleep
- Lose alertness
- Become passive

### Making It Work

**If lying down:**
- Keep some alertness cues
- Arms at sides, palms up (traditional)
- Pillow under knees if helpful
- Know sleepiness risk

---

## Upper Body Position

### Head and Neck

**Position:**
- Head balanced on spine
- Chin slightly tucked (not dropped)
- Neck long
- Not craning or jutting forward

### Shoulders and Arms

**Relaxed:**
- Shoulders dropped away from ears
- Arms hanging naturally
- Hands resting on thighs or knees
- No holding or gripping

### Hands

**Options:**
- Resting on thighs
- In lap, one on top of other
- Various mudras (hand positions)
- Whatever is comfortable

---

## Eyes

### Open or Closed

**Traditions vary:**
- Closed: reduces visual distraction
- Open: maintains alertness
- Half-open: balance (gaze downward)

**Try:**
- What works for you
- May change over time
- Following teacher guidance if learning

---

## Dealing with Discomfort

### It's Normal

**Expect:**
- Some discomfort, especially starting out
- Body adapts over time
- Build duration gradually
- Not meant to be painful

### When to Move

**Balance:**
- Some stillness is the practice
- But severe pain isn't the goal
- Minor discomfort can be observed
- Adjust when needed without drama

### Modifying

**Options:**
- Change position
- Add support
- Shorter sessions
- Different posture entirely

---

## Building Up

### Starting Out

**Beginner approach:**
- Short sessions (5-10 minutes)
- Comfortable position priority
- Build duration gradually
- Posture settles over time

### Over Time

**With practice:**
- Posture becomes more natural
- Duration extends
- Less adjustment needed
- Find your preferred position

---

## Movement Meditation

### Walking Meditation

**Different posture:**
- Standing/walking position
- Slow, deliberate movement
- Attention to body in motion
- No sitting challenges

### Other Options

**Movement practices:**
- Tai chi
- Qigong
- Mindful yoga
- Any conscious movement

---

## Common Issues

### Sleepiness

**If drowsy:**
- Try more upright position
- Open eyes
- Cooler room
- Earlier in day
- Chair instead of lying

### Pain

**If painful:**
- Add cushion height
- Try different position
- Chair option
- Shorter sessions
- Check for medical issues

### Restlessness

**If can't be still:**
- Walking meditation first
- Movement practice
- Brief sessions
- Build gradually
