# Posture During Housework and Cleaning

> **Protect Your Back at Home:** Housework involves lots of bending, reaching, and repetitive movements. Good body mechanics make these tasks safer and more comfortable.

---

## Why Housework Posture Matters

### The Challenge

Housework often involves:
- Repetitive movements
- Bending and reaching
- Carrying loads
- Sustained positions
- Twisting motions

### Common Problems

Poor technique can cause:
- Lower back strain
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Knee discomfort
- Fatigue
- Cumulative injury

### The Good News

With awareness:
- Tasks become easier
- Less pain afterward
- Can be exercise opportunity
- Better body mechanics become habit

## General Principles

### Body Mechanics Basics

**For all tasks:**
- Bend knees, not back
- Keep loads close to body
- Avoid twisting under load
- Maintain neutral spine
- Change positions frequently

### Work Smart

- Use proper tools for reach
- Take breaks
- Alternate tasks
- Don't rush

## Task-Specific Guidance

### Vacuuming

**Common problems:**
- Bending forward constantly
- Twisting to reach
- Gripping tightly
- Repetitive pushing

**Better approach:**
- Stand upright
- Step forward and back (lunge pattern)
- Use legs to move, not just arms
- Keep vacuum close
- Switch hands periodically
- Adjust handle length if possible

### Mopping and Sweeping

**Similar to vacuuming:**
- Stand tall
- Use your legs to move
- Step into the motion
- Don't over-reach
- Keep handle at comfortable length
- Take breaks to stand fully upright

### Dusting and Wiping

**High surfaces:**
- Use step stool (don't overreach)
- Keep work below shoulder height when possible
- Face your work directly
- Avoid prolonged overhead reaching

**Low surfaces:**
- Squat or kneel (don't bend from waist)
- Use kneeling pad
- One knee down is fine
- Straighten up frequently

### Making Beds

**Common issue:** Bending over bed repeatedly

**Better approach:**
- Kneel at bedside
- Move around the bed (don't reach across)
- Use fitted sheets with deep pockets
- Consider bed risers for easier access
- Do one side at a time

### Laundry

**Loading/unloading:**
- Squat or kneel to access drum
- Don't bend at waist repeatedly
- Consider front-load machines
- Carry smaller loads more often

**Folding:**
- At waist-height surface
- Don't hunch over low table
- Take sitting breaks

**Carrying:**
- Close to body
- Don't twist to pick up
- Make multiple trips if heavy
- Use basket with handles

### Dishes and Cooking

**At the sink:**
- Stand close
- Consider anti-fatigue mat
- Don't hunch over
- Keep items within easy reach

**Lifting pots:**
- Bend knees for low cupboards
- Two hands for heavy items
- Face the cupboard (don't twist)

**Working at counter:**
- Counter height matters
- Stand on step if counter too high
- Don't lean forward excessively
- Shift weight and move

### Floor Cleaning (Hands and Knees)

**If scrubbing on floor:**
- Use kneeling pad
- Alternate which knee is forward
- Keep back neutral (not rounded or arched)
- Get up and stretch every few minutes
- Consider long-handled tools instead

---

## Reaching and Lifting

### High Shelves

- Use step stool
- Face shelf directly
- Don't twist while holding items
- Bring items close before descending

### Low Areas

- Squat or kneel
- One knee on ground is stable
- Keep back neutral
- Use grab bars or furniture for support if needed

### Carrying

- Hold close to body
- Make eye contact with path
- Clear pathway first
- Multiple trips beat one heavy load

---

## Preventing Fatigue

### Pace Yourself

- Alternate heavy and light tasks
- Take short breaks
- Stay hydrated
- Don't marathon clean

### Mix It Up

- Switch between tasks
- Alternate body positions
- Change which hand/side leads
- Avoid repetitive strain

### Work in Intervals

- 20-30 minutes of work
- 5-minute break
- Stretch or change activity
- Resume

## Quick Stretches During Cleaning

### Every 20-30 Minutes

**Standing back extension:**

- 5 repetitions

**Shoulder rolls:**
- 10 forward
- 10 backward

**Side stretch:**
- Reach overhead
- Lean each direction
- 15 seconds each

**Hip flexor stretch:**
- Lunge position
- 20 seconds each side
