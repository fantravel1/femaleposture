# Guitar Posture

## Seated Playing

- Less formal
- Still maintain posture
- Awareness needed
- Common approach

## Standing Playing

### Strap Height

**Proper adjustment:**
- Guitar at comfortable height
- Arms can move freely
- Not too low
- Shoulder strap comfort
- Balance maintained

### Body Position

**Standing form:**
- Weight balanced
- Shoulders level
- Core engaged
- Guitar secure
- Relaxed stance

## Hand Position

### Fretting Hand

**Left hand:**
- Thumb behind neck
- Curved fingers
- Wrist neutral
- Efficient finger placement
- No excessive tension

### Strumming Hand

**Right hand:**
- Relaxed forearm
- Wrist flexible
- Pick grip comfortable
- Natural movement
- Varied techniques

## Common Issues

### Shoulder Strain

**From asymmetry:**
- Posture awareness
- Both sides worked
- Regular breaks
- Strengthening exercises
- Position variation

### Wrist Problems

**From fretting:**

Good guitar posture supports musical development while protecting your body from the repetitive strains of practice.
