# Kayaking Posture

Kayaking challenges the body with seated paddling motion requiring core rotation and upper body work. Proper kayaking posture protects your back and shoulders while improving efficiency.

## Seating Position

### Proper Setup

**In the kayak:**
- Sit bones on seat
- Knees against thigh braces
- Feet on pedals
- Back support used
- Upright posture

### Body Position

**Aligned sitting:**
- Tall spine
- Core engaged
- Shoulders relaxed
- Head balanced
- Hips stable

## Paddle Technique

### Proper Stroke

**Efficient paddling:**
- Torso rotation
- Core power
- Arms guide paddle
- Catch and drive
- Clean exit

### Hand Position

**Grip technique:**
- Relaxed grip
- Proper width
- Wrists neutral
- Control without tension
- Symmetrical stroke

## Common Errors

### What to Avoid

**Problematic technique:**
- Arms-only paddling
- Hunched shoulders
- Death grip
- Asymmetric stroke
- Poor posture

### Corrections

**Better form:**
- Rotation from core
- Relaxed upper body
- Light grip
- Balanced strokes
- Upright position

## Women-Specific Considerations

### Fit and Comfort

**Female paddlers:**
- Boat fit
- Paddle sizing
- PFD fit
- Seating comfort
- Equipment adaptation

### Building Strength

**Training focus:**
- Core strength

Good kayaking posture uses the core for power while protecting shoulders and back through hours of paddling.
