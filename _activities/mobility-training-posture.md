# Mobility Training Posture

Mobility training improves joint function. Proper posture enables safe, effective movement.

## Principles

### Active vs Passive

**Types of mobility:**
- Active through range
- Controlled articulation
- Strength at end range
- Passive stretching
- Combined approaches

### Controlled Movement

**Quality motion:**
- Smooth movement
- Full range
- Controlled speed
- Joint focus
- Intentional motion

## Hip Mobility

### Hip Circles

**Full rotation:**
- Hands and knees
- Circular motion
- Full range
- Both directions
- Controlled movement

### 90/90 Position

**Hip positioning:**
- Both legs bent 90°
- Tall torso
- Rotate between
- Hip opening
- Mobility development

## Shoulder Mobility

### Arm Circles

**Full range:**
- Standing tall
- Full arm circles
- Both directions
- Controlled motion
- Shoulder warm-up

### Wall Slides

**Scapular motion:**
- Back to wall
- Arms slide up
- Maintain contact
- Full range
- Postural focus

## Spine Mobility

### Cat-Cow

**Spinal flexion/extension:**
- Hands and knees
- Arch and round
- Full range
- Breath coordinated
- Gentle movement

### Thoracic Rotation

**Mid-back turning:**
- Side-lying
- Rotation movement
- Open chest
- Controlled motion
- Both sides

## Integration

### Movement Flow

**Combined mobility:**
- Link movements
- Continuous flow
- Full body coverage
- Warm-up application
- Daily practice

Good mobility training posture enables safe, effective joint function improvement.
