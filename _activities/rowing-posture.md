# Rowing Posture

Rowing demands precise technique—the repetitive nature means small form errors compound into injury. Understanding proper rowing posture protects your back while maximizing power.

## The Rowing Stroke

### Catch Position

**Start of stroke:**
- Shins vertical
- Arms extended
- Back upright
- Core engaged
- Shoulders relaxed

### Drive Phase

**Power application:**
- Legs drive first
- Back opens second
- Arms pull last
- Core stable
- Sequential power

### Finish Position

**End of stroke:**
- Legs extended
- Back slightly reclined
- Handle to chest
- Elbows back
- Controlled position

### Recovery

**Return to catch:**
- Arms extend first
- Body swings forward
- Knees come up
- Controlled slide
- Smooth transition

## Common Errors

### Technique Problems

**What to avoid:**
- Back first instead of legs
- Over-reaching at catch
- Excessive lay-back
- Pulling with arms early
- Rushing the slide

### Corrections

**Better form:**
- Legs-back-arms sequence
- Appropriate reach
- Controlled finish
- Sequential power
- Patient recovery

## Women-Specific Considerations

### Physical Factors

**Female rowing:**
- Flexibility use
- Core strength emphasis
- Back protection
- Hip mechanics
- Endurance building

### Injury Prevention

**Common issues:**
- Low back strain
- Rib stress injuries
- Wrist issues
- Knee problems
- Prevention strategies

Good rowing posture creates efficient, powerful strokes while protecting your back through thousands of repetitions.
