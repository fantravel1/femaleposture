# Plyometrics Posture

Plyometrics develop explosive power. Proper posture enables safe, effective jump training.

## Principles

### Stretch-Shortening Cycle

**Explosive power:**
- Eccentric load
- Quick transition
- Concentric explosion
- Maximum force
- Speed development

### Landing Quality

**Safe landing:**
- Soft and quiet
- Absorb with legs
- Hips back
- Knee tracking
- Controlled deceleration

## Lower Body

### Vertical Jumps

**Upward focus:**
- Squat jumps
- Tuck jumps
- Jump squats
- Maximum height
- Soft landings

### Horizontal Jumps

**Forward focus:**
- Broad jumps
- Bounding
- Hurdle jumps
- Distance focus
- Controlled landing

### Single Leg

**Unilateral:**
- Single leg hops
- Skaters
- Split jumps
- Balance challenge
- Asymmetry correction

## Upper Body

### Push-up Variations

**Explosive push:**
- Clap push-ups
- Plyo push-ups
- Explosive start
- Soft landing
- Core engaged

### Medicine Ball

**Throwing:**
- Chest passes
- Overhead throws
- Rotational throws
- Power development
- Partner optional

## Programming

### Volume Management

**Safe progression:**
- Low contacts start
- Progressive increase
- Quality over quantity
- Recovery time
- Injury prevention

Good plyometrics posture develops explosive power with safe landing mechanics.
