# Exercise Posture and Form Guide

> **Form Before Everything:** Good exercise form prevents injury, improves results, and builds lasting strength. These principles apply across all fitness activities.

---

## Why Form Matters

### Injury Prevention

**Poor form leads to:**
- Acute injuries
- Overuse injuries
- Joint damage
- Chronic pain
- Exercise dropout

### Better Results

**Good form means:**
- Right muscles working
- More effective training
- Sustainable practice
- Long-term progress

---

## Universal Principles

### Core Engagement

**The foundation:**
- Core is center of all movement
- Not sucking in—gentle bracing
- Stabilizes spine
- Engaged for most exercises

### Neutral Spine

**What it means:**
- Natural curves maintained
- Not flattened, not exaggerated
- Applies to most activities
- Foundation of safe movement

### Breath

**General rule:**
- Exhale on effort
- Don't hold breath
- Rhythmic breathing
- Supports movement

---

## Standing Exercise Posture

### Base Position

**Setup:**
- Feet hip to shoulder width
- Weight distributed evenly
- Knees soft (not locked)
- Core engaged
- Shoulders back and down
- Head neutral

### During Movement

**Maintain:**
- Spine alignment
- Core activation
- Controlled movement
- Proper weight distribution

---

## Squatting

### Form Essentials

**Setup:**
- Feet shoulder-width or slightly wider
- Toes can point slightly out
- Weight in heels and midfoot

**Movement:**
- Hips back first
- Knees track over toes
- Chest stays up
- Depth as mobility allows
- Drive through heels to stand

### Common Errors

**Avoid:**
- Knees caving in
- Rounding lower back
- Lifting heels
- Looking down
- Not sitting back enough

---

## Deadlift/Hinging

### Form Essentials

**Hinge pattern:**
- Bend at hips, not waist
- Slight knee bend
- Back stays flat
- Core engaged
- Weight close to body

**Movement:**
- Push hips back
- Back straight (not rounded)
- Shoulder blades back
- Stand by extending hips

### Common Errors

**Avoid:**
- Rounding back
- Straight legs
- Weight too far from body
- Looking up (neck strain)
- Using back instead of legs

---

## Pushing Movements

### Push-Ups

**Form:**
- Hands slightly wider than shoulders
- Core tight (body straight line)
- Lower with control
- Elbows at about 45 degrees
- Full range of motion

**Modifications:**
- Knees down (still straight line)
- Incline on bench/wall
- Build to full

### Overhead Press

**Form:**
- Core braced
- No excessive back arch
- Press in straight path
- Full lockout
- Controlled lowering

---

## Pulling Movements

### Rows

**Form:**
- Flat back
- Core engaged
- Pull to torso
- Squeeze shoulder blades
- Controlled release

### Pull-Ups/Lat Pulldowns

**Form:**
- Shoulders down and back
- Pull to chest level
- Control the eccentric
- No swinging/kipping (for form focus)

---

## Cardio Posture

### Running/Jogging

**Form:**
- Upright posture (slight forward lean from ankles)
- Relaxed shoulders
- Arms swing forward/back (not across body)
- Core engaged
- Foot strike varies (individualized)

### Walking

**Form:**
- Upright posture
- Swing arms naturally
- Eyes forward
- Roll through foot
- Comfortable stride

### Cycling

**Form:**
- Bike fit is critical

---

## Group Fitness

### Following Instructor

**Form focus:**
- Form over speed/intensity
- Modify as needed
- Watch demonstrations
- Don't sacrifice form to keep up

### Common Classes

**HIIT:**
- Form especially important when fatigued
- Slow down if form breaks
- Modifications available

**Dance/Aerobics:**
- Learn movements before intensity
- Modify impact as needed
- Form over coordination initially

---

## Weight Training Basics

### Starting Out

**Priority:**
- Learn movements unweighted first
- Add weight gradually
- Form before load
- Ego aside

### Progressive Loading

**Safe progression:**
- Increase only when form is solid
- Small increments
- Not too much too soon
- Consistency over heroics

### When Form Breaks

**The rule:**
- If form goes, stop or reduce
- Fatigue = form breakdown
- That's your limit for today
- Better to build than break

---

## Flexibility Work

### Stretching Form

**General principles:**
- Warm body first (after workout or light movement)
- No bouncing (static hold)
- Breathe into stretch
- Hold 30+ seconds
- Sensation, not pain

### Yoga

**Form matters:**
- Modifications are valid
- Alignment important
- Props are tools, not crutches
- Listen to your body

---

## Recovery Position

### Between Sets

**Rest position:**
- Stand or sit with good posture
- Walk it out if needed
- Prepare for next set
- Breathe and recover

### Cool Down

**After workout:**
- Gradual reduction
- Stretching
- Recovery posture matters too

---
