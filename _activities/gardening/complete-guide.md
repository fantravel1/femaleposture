# Gardening Posture Guide

> **Growing a Garden, Not Pain:** Gardening is wonderful exercise, but bending, kneeling, and lifting can strain your body. Smart techniques keep you gardening for years.

---

## The Gardening Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Bending repeatedly** - Planting, weeding, harvesting
- **Kneeling on hard ground** - Extended ground-level work
- **Lifting** - Soil bags, pots, equipment
- **Reaching** - Pruning, picking, stretching
- **Repetitive motions** - Digging, raking, pulling

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain
- Knee soreness
- Shoulder strain
- Hand and wrist pain
- Neck stiffness
- Overall body ache

---

## General Principles

### Warm Up First

**Before gardening:**
- Brief walk
- Gentle stretches
- Arm circles
- Knee bends
- Don't start cold

### Pace Yourself

- Not a marathon
- Multiple sessions
- Rest breaks
- Listen to your body
- Tomorrow is another day

### Variety Is Key

**Rotate tasks:**
- Don't weed for hours
- Alternate activities
- Different positions
- Different muscle groups

---

## Kneeling and Ground Work

### Knee Protection

**Essential:**
- Thick kneeling pad
- Garden kneeler/seat
- Foam mat
- Something between you and ground

### Kneeling Positions

**Options:**
- Both knees (pad essential)
- One knee up (alternate)
- Kneeling seat
- Low stool

**Switching:**
- Change legs regularly
- Don't stay in one position
- Get up periodically

### Garden Stool

**Benefits:**

- Less knee strain
- Easier to rise
- Some have handles
- Flip for kneeling pad

---

## Bending and Stooping

### The Problem

**Repeated bending:**
- Strains lower back
- Unsustainable for long periods
- Cumulative damage

### Better Options

**Squat or lunge:**
- Bending at knees, not waist
- Power from legs
- Back more neutral

**Kneel instead:**
- For ground-level work
- With proper padding
- Better than constant bending

**Raised beds:**
- Bring work up to you
- Less bending required
- Worth the investment

---

## Digging

### Shovel Technique

**Proper form:**
- Foot on shovel blade
- Bend knees
- Keep back relatively straight
- Lift with legs
- Don't twist to throw soil

**Avoid:**
- Rounding back to scoop
- Twisting while loaded
- Overloading shovel
- Rushing

### Taking Breaks

- Digging is hard work
- Frequent rests
- Stretch lower back
- Hydrate

---

## Weeding

### Position

**Options:**
- Kneeling (padded)
- Sitting on stool
- Standing weeder tools
- Not hunched bending

### Technique

- Work close to body
- Move with the weeds
- Don't overreach
- Pull straight up or at angle
- Use tools when helpful

### Duration

- Break into sessions
- 15-20 minutes then switch tasks
- Don't marathon weed
- Back will thank you

## Adapting with Age or Limitations

### Raised Beds
