# Gardening Posture: Protect Your Back While Gardening

> **Garden Without Pain:** Gardening is excellent for body and mind, but it can also strain your back, knees, and shoulders if done incorrectly. Here's how to garden safely.

---

## Why Gardening Causes Pain

### Common Problem Areas

- **Lower back:** Bending, lifting, twisting
- **Knees:** Kneeling, squatting
- **Shoulders:** Reaching, digging
- **Neck:** Looking down for extended periods
- **Wrists and hands:** Gripping, repetitive motions

### What Causes Issues

- Prolonged bending
- Heavy lifting without proper form
- Staying in one position too long
- Twisting while lifting
- Reaching beyond comfortable range

---

## Body Mechanics for Gardening

### Bending and Stooping

**Instead of bending at waist:**
- Squat (if knees allow)
- Kneel on one or both knees
- Use a garden stool or seat
- Raise beds to reduce bending

**If you must bend:**
- Hinge at hips, not lower back
- Bend knees slightly
- Keep back as straight as possible
- Limit duration

### Lifting

**Proper lifting technique:**
1. Get close to the object
2. Squat down, keeping back straight
3. Grip firmly
4. Lift with legs, not back
5. Don't twist—turn your whole body
6. Hold load close to body

**For heavy items:**
- Get help
- Use wheelbarrow or cart
- Break into smaller loads
- Don't overdo it

### Kneeling

**Protect your knees:**
- Use knee pads
- Use a kneeling pad
- Use garden kneeler/bench
- Alternate positions frequently

**When kneeling:**
- Shift weight periodically
- Don't stay down too long
- Use one knee, then the other

### Digging and Raking

**Reduce strain:**
- Keep back relatively straight
- Let arms and legs do work
- Don't overreach
- Switch sides periodically
- Use long-handled tools

### Carrying

**For buckets and tools:**
- Carry balanced loads
- Distribute weight evenly
- Make multiple trips
- Use wheelbarrow for heavy loads
- Keep items close to body
