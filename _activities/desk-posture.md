# Desk Posture

For millions of women, office work means spending 8 or more hours a day sitting. This guide will help you optimize your workspace and maintain healthy posture, considering the specific needs of the female body.

## The Problem with Sitting

### Why It Affects Posture

**Effects of sedentary position:**
- Hip flexors shorten
- Glutes weaken
- Upper back rounds
- Neck projects forward
- Shoulders round

**Concerning statistics:**
- Average of 10+ hours sitting per day
- Increases chronic pain risk
- Affects metabolism
- Impacts overall health

## Ergonomic Setup

### The Chair

**Essential adjustments:**
- Height: feet flat on floor, knees at 90°
- Depth: 2-3 fingers between seat and knees
- Backrest: lumbar support at lower curve
- Armrests: shoulders relaxed, elbows at 90°

**For women:**
- Many chairs are designed for men
- May need additional lumbar cushion
- Consider smaller-sized chairs if petite
- Adjust seat depth accordingly

### The Desk

**Correct height:**
- Elbows at 90° with arms on keyboard
- Wrists in neutral position
- Consider adjustable desk
- Option to alternate sitting/standing

**Organization:**
- Frequent items within reach
- Avoid reaching or twisting repeatedly
- Space to move

### The Screen

**Optimal position:**
- Top at eye level
- Arm's length away
- Directly in front (not angled)
- Avoid glare

**For laptop users:**
- Use a riser/stand
- External keyboard and mouse
- Additional monitor if possible

### Keyboard and Mouse

**Correct position:**
- Shoulders relaxed, not elevated
- Elbows close to body
- Wrists straight, not bent
- Mouse close to keyboard

## The Ideal Sitting Posture

### Correct Alignment

**From bottom to top:**
1. **Feet:** Flat on floor or footrest
2. **Knees:** At 90° or slightly more
3. **Hips:** At back of chair
4. **Pelvis:** Neutral, not tilted
5. **Back:** Supported, natural curves
6. **Shoulders:** Relaxed, back
7. **Head:** Over shoulders, chin neutral
8. **Eyes:** Looking forward

### What to Avoid

**Problematic postures:**
