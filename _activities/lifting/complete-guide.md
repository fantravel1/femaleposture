# Lifting Posture Guide

> **Every Lift Counts:** Whether it's a child, a box, or groceries, how you lift matters. Proper technique prevents the back injuries that derail lives.

---

## Why Lifting Technique Matters

### The Risk

**Poor lifting causes:**
- Acute back injuries
- Disc problems
- Muscle strains
- Chronic pain
- Long-term damage

### The Opportunity

**Good technique:**
- Prevents injury
- Uses body efficiently
- Becomes automatic with practice
- Protects for lifetime

---

## Basic Lifting Technique

### The Setup

1. **Get close to the object**
   - Directly in front
   - As close as possible
   - Object between feet if possible

2. **Wide, stable base**
   - Feet shoulder-width or wider
   - Staggered stance often helps
   - Stable before you lift

3. **Assess the load**
   - How heavy?
   - Where are handles?
   - Need help?

### The Lift

4. **Squat down**
   - Bend knees and hips
   - Keep back straight (not vertical, just not rounded)
   - Head up, looking forward

5. **Grip firmly**
   - Secure hold
   - Both hands when possible
   - Good grip before lifting

6. **Engage core**
   - Tighten abdominal muscles
   - Protect spine
   - Creates stability

7. **Lift with legs**
   - Drive through legs to stand
   - Back angle stays constant initially
   - Legs do the work

8. **Keep load close**
   - Object against or near body
   - Never extended away while lifting
   - Close = less strain

### During Carry

9. **Don't twist while carrying**
   - Move feet to turn
   - No twisting at waist with load
   - Pivot, don't rotate

10. **Set down carefully**
    - Reverse the process
    - Squat down
    - Don't drop or throw

## Common Lifting Mistakes

### Rounding the Back

**The problem:**
- Bending from waist
- Back rounded forward
- Disc pressure increased
- Injury risk high

**The fix:**
- Hip hinge with straight spine
- "Chest up" cue helps
- Practice the movement

### Lifting Away from Body

**The problem:**
- Object at arm's length
- Leverage multiplies load
- Back strain increases

**The fix:**
- Get close first
- Pull toward body
- Never lift extended

### Twisting Under Load

**The problem:**
- Rotating while holding weight
- Shear forces on spine
- Very common injury cause

**The fix:**
- Move feet to turn
- Face your destination
- Pivot, don't twist

### Lifting Too Much

**The problem:**
- Ego or urgency
- Exceeding capacity
- Injury results

**The fix:**
- Get help
- Use equipment
- Make multiple trips
- Know limits

## Different Lifting Scenarios

### From Floor

**Low lifting:**
- Full squat or lunge
- Very close to object

### From Waist Height

**Mid-level:**

- Don't round back

### Overhead Lifting

**Putting up high:**

- Then to chest
- Then overhead
- Use ladder if reaching

### Awkward Objects

**Difficult shapes:**
- Find best grip points
- Get help if awkward
- Break into pieces if possible
- Special care required

## Everyday Lifting

### Groceries

**Common lifts:**
- From trunk to ground to house
- Each lift matters
