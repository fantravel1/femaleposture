# Work From Home Posture Guide

> **Your Living Room Isn't an Office (But It Can Work):** Remote work offers flexibility—and ergonomic challenges. Creating a proper setup protects your body long-term.

---

## The WFH Challenge

### Why Home Work Is Different

- **No default setup** - You create the environment
- **Casual locations tempting** - Couch, bed, kitchen table
- **Blurred boundaries** - Work everywhere = strain everywhere
- **Less movement** - No commute, no walking to meetings
- **Isolation** - No one notices your slouching

### Common Problems

- Laptop-based neck strain
- Makeshift desk issues
- Couch and bed working
- Longer hours, less movement
- No separation between work and rest spaces

---

## Setting Up Your Space

### Dedicated Space Matters

**Why:**
- Consistent ergonomics
- Mental work/life separation
- Can optimize properly
- Sustainable long-term

**If limited space:**
- Define a consistent spot
- Use the same setup daily
- Create start/end rituals
- Still optimize what's there

### Basic Equipment

**Essentials:**
- Proper chair (or alternative)
- Appropriate surface height
- Monitor/laptop at eye level
- Separate keyboard if using laptop

**See:** [Home Office Setup Checklist](/tools/home-office-setup-checklist/)

---

## The Laptop Problem

### Laptops Are Terrible for Posture

**The inherent problem:**
- Screen attached to keyboard
- Looking down = neck strain
- Reaching down = shoulder strain
- Can't have both at right height

### Solutions

**Option 1 - Laptop stand + external keyboard:**
- Raise laptop screen to eye level
- External keyboard at elbow height
- Best of both worlds
- Investment worth it

**Option 2 - External monitor:**
- Larger screen at proper height
- Laptop as keyboard (or external)
- Better for extended work
- Ideal if space allows

**At minimum:**
- Raise laptop higher
- Accept typing position compromise
- For short sessions only
- Not for all-day work

---

## Chair Options

### Traditional Desk Chair

**What works:**
- Adjustable height
- Lumbar support
- Comfortable for hours
- Office-quality construction

**Budget options:**
- Can work
- Add cushion/lumbar support
- Make adjustments
- Better than kitchen chair

### Alternative Seating

**Options:**
- Standing desk
- Kneeling chair
- Exercise ball (not all day)
- Stool (not all day)

**Best approach:**
- Variety of positions
- Primary good chair
- Alternatives for variety
- Not one thing all day

---

## Common WFH Mistakes

### The Couch

**Why it fails:**
- No back support at right height
- Laptop in lap = looking down
- Positions encourage slouching
- Not for extended work

**If you must:**
- Brief sessions only
- Laptop raised on cushion
- Back support
- Not your primary spot

### The Bed

**Even worse:**
- No support structures
- Encourages lying/hunching
- Terrible for neck
- Also affects sleep association

**Just don't.**

### The Kitchen Table

**Common default:**
- Chair height likely wrong
- Table height may not work
- No lumbar support
- Temporary solution only

**Making it work:**
- Cushion for height
- Rolled towel for lumbar
- Monitor raised on books
- Better than couch/bed

---

## Movement at Home

### The Lost Commute

**Previously:**
- Walk to car/transit
- Walk to office
- Walk to meetings
- Built-in movement

**Now:**
- Bed to desk
- Desk to kitchen
- Back to desk
- Minimal movement

### Creating Movement

**Intentional:**
- Walk before/after work (fake commute)
- Walking meetings (phone calls)
- Movement breaks every hour
- Exercise routines

**Built-in:**
- Printer in another room
- Water/coffee in kitchen
- Stand for certain tasks
- Movement = normal

---

## Video Call Posture

### Camera Positioning

**Setup:**
- Eye level or slightly above
- Good lighting (not backlit)
- Appropriate distance
- Not looking down at laptop

**Why it matters:**
- Looking down = double chin + neck strain
- Looking up = awkward
- Posture visible to others

### During Calls

**Maintain:**
- Good seated posture
- Back supported
- Eyes on camera level
- Natural position

**When you're not center stage:**
- Can stretch subtly
- Position shifts
- Movement okay
- Camera off = full movement

---

## Work-Life Posture Boundaries

### When Work Is Everywhere

**The problem:**
- Working from couch = couch becomes work
- Working from bed = bed becomes work
- No physical separation
- Always at work

### Creating Boundaries

**Physical:**
- Work space is for work
- Rest space is for rest
- Close laptop when done
- Leave work area

**Postural:**
- Work posture in work space
- Relaxed posture in rest space
- Different positions for different activities

---

## Taking Breaks at Home

### No Natural Interruptions

**Office provided:**
- Walking to meetings
- Coffee runs
- Colleague conversations
- Natural movement

**At home:**
- Must create them
- Timer/reminders
- Scheduled breaks
- Movement non-negotiable

### What to Do on Breaks

**Movement:**
- Walk around
- Stretch routine
- Different room
- Outside if possible

**Not:**
- Different screen
- Phone scrolling
- More sitting
- Continued work posture

---

## Hybrid Work Considerations

### Switching Environments

**Consistency:**
- Good posture both places
- Don't sacrifice at home
- Carry necessary supports
- Same habits apply

### Equipment Duplication

**Consider:**
- Monitor at home and office
- Keyboard at both
- Chair consistency
- Reduces compromise

---

## Children and Pets

### Interruption-Induced Strain

**Quick movements:**
- Jumping up suddenly
- Awkward positions
- Picking up child/pet repeatedly
- Divided attention

### Managing

**Strategies:**
- Proper breaks (attend to them then)
- Setup that accommodates interruptions
- Good habits even when distracted
- Accepting imperfection

---

## Long-Term WFH Health

### This Is Your Workspace Now

**Investment:**
- Proper setup pays off
- Ergonomics prevent injury
- Short-term expense, long-term savings
- Your body, your responsibility

### Regular Assessment

**Check periodically:**
- Any new pains?
- Setup still working?
- Habits maintained?
- Changes needed?
