# Bending Posture Guide

> **You Bend Hundreds of Times Daily:** From picking things up to loading the dishwasher—every bend affects your back. Good technique protects you.

---

## Why Bending Technique Matters

### The Frequency

**You bend constantly:**
- Picking things up
- Reaching low drawers
- Putting on shoes
- Cleaning
- Countless daily motions

### The Risk

**Poor bending creates:**
- Disc pressure
- Ligament strain
- Muscle overload
- Cumulative damage
- Acute injury potential

---

## The Hip Hinge

### The Foundation

**The hip hinge:**
- Bending at the hips, not waist
- Spine stays neutral
- Sends butt back
- Essential movement pattern

### How to Hip Hinge

1. **Stand with feet hip-width**
2. **Soft knees (slightly bent)**
3. **Push hips back**
4. **Let torso tilt forward**
5. **Back stays flat**
6. **Feel it in hamstrings**

### Practice

**Building the pattern:**
- Practice against wall (butt touches wall as you hinge)
- Dowel on spine (head, upper back, sacrum contact)
- Daily practice
- Make automatic
