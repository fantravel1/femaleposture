# Desk Work Ergonomics: Complete Guide to Office Posture

> **Your Desk Is Where You Live:** Many people spend 8+ hours at a desk. Proper setup can mean the difference between chronic pain and comfortable, productive work.

---

## The Impact of Poor Desk Setup

### What Goes Wrong

- Neck and shoulder pain
- Lower back pain
- Headaches
- Wrist and hand problems
- Eye strain
- Fatigue
- Long-term posture issues

### Why It Matters

You can't outrun 8 hours of bad ergonomics with 30 minutes of exercise. Setup must be right.

---

## Chair Setup

### Seat Height

**Correct:**
- Feet flat on floor (or footrest)
- Thighs parallel to floor or slightly angled down
- No pressure behind knees
- Can slide 2-3 fingers under thighs at seat edge

**Adjust:** Raise or lower seat until correct.

### Seat Depth

**Correct:**
- 2-3 inches between back of knees and seat edge
- Full thigh support
- Can use backrest comfortably

**Adjust:** Slide seat pan forward/back, or use lumbar cushion to effectively reduce depth.

### Backrest

**Correct:**
- Supports natural curve of lower back
- Upper back supported
- Can lean back occasionally (not locked upright)

**Adjust:** Position lumbar support at curve of lower back. Adjust backrest angle.

### Armrests

**Correct:**
- Shoulders relaxed when using
- Forearms parallel to floor
- Elbows at 90 degrees
- Not pushing shoulders up

**Adjust:** Height and width. Or remove if they prevent proper positioning.

---

## Desk/Work Surface

### Height

**Correct:**
- When sitting with arms at sides, bent 90 degrees:
  - Forearms parallel to floor
  - Keyboard at or slightly below elbow height
  - Shoulders relaxed

**Adjust:** Desk height if adjustable. Otherwise adjust chair and use footrest.

### Space

**Correct:**
- Frequently used items within easy reach
- Space for mouse and keyboard without reaching
- Legs can move freely underneath
- No clutter causing awkward positions

---

## Monitor Position

### Height

**Correct:**
- Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- Looking straight ahead or slightly down (10-20 degrees)
- Not looking up
- Not looking down significantly

**Adjust:** Use monitor stand, arm, or books to raise. Lower if too high.

### Distance

**Correct:**
- About arm's length away (20-30 inches)
- Can read without leaning forward
- Not so far that you squint

### Angle

**Correct:**
- Tilted slightly back (10-20 degrees)
- No glare from windows or lights
- Brightness matches environment

### Multiple Monitors

- Primary monitor directly in front
- Secondary monitor adjacent (not requiring major head turn)
- Same height for both
- Consider which you look at most

---

## Keyboard and Mouse

### Keyboard Position

**Correct:**
- Directly in front of you
- Close to body edge of desk
- Keyboard legs not raised (flat or negative tilt)
- Wrists neutral (not bent up or down)

### Mouse Position

**Correct:**
- Next to keyboard at same level
- Close enough to not require reaching
- Can use without arm extended
- Consider mouse size for your hand

### Typing Posture

**Correct:**
- Wrists floating or lightly supported
- Not resting heavily on wrist rest while typing
- Fingers drop down to keys
- Light touch

---

## Laptop Considerations

### Laptops Are Not Ergonomic

The attached screen and keyboard create a trade-off:
- Screen at eye level = keyboard too high
- Keyboard at right height = screen too low

### Solutions

**For extended use:**
- External keyboard and mouse
- Laptop stand to raise screen
- Or external monitor

**For occasional use:**
- Prioritize screen height (neck is more vulnerable)
- Take more frequent breaks
- Don't work all day on laptop alone

---

## Lighting

### General Lighting

- Bright enough to see work
- Not causing glare on screen
- Even illumination

### Screen and Light Interaction

- Screen not facing window (glare)
- Window to side is ideal
- Use blinds to control light
- Screen brightness matches room

### Task Lighting

- For paper work if needed
- Positioned to not cause glare
- Adjustable for preference

---

## The Ideal Sitting Position

### Checklist

☐ Feet flat on floor or footrest
☐ Knees at about 90 degrees
☐ Thighs parallel or slightly angled
☐ Back against backrest
☐ Lumbar support in place
☐ Shoulders relaxed, not shrugged
☐ Elbows at 90 degrees
☐ Forearms parallel to floor
☐ Wrists neutral
☐ Screen at eye level
☐ Screen at arm's length
☐ Head balanced over spine

---

## Movement Is Essential

### No Perfect Position Stays Perfect

The best position becomes bad if held too long.

### Break Schedule

- **Micro-breaks:** Every 20-30 minutes (look away, stretch)
- **Movement breaks:** Every hour (stand, walk, stretch)
- **Longer breaks:** Every 2 hours (5-10 minute movement)

### Movement Options

- Stand and stretch
- Walk to get water
- Take stairs
- Walking meetings
- Desk exercises
- Standing work periods

---

## Standing Desks

### Benefits

- Changes position
- Reduces sitting time
- Can improve alertness
- Option for variety

### But

- Standing all day isn't ideal either
- Must be at proper height
- Fatigue occurs
- Alternating sit/stand is best

### Setup

**Standing height:**
- Same as sitting—elbows at 90 degrees
- Screen at eye level
- Anti-fatigue mat helpful
- Footrest to shift weight

**Ideal use:**
- Alternate sitting and standing
- Stand for 15-30 minutes, then sit
- Listen to your body
