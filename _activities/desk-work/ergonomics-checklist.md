# Complete Office Ergonomics Checklist for Women

> **The problem:** Most office furniture is designed for the "average" worker—who is typically male, 5'10", and 180 lbs. If that's not you, your workspace is working against your posture. Here's how to fix it.

---

## Why Standard Setups Don't Work for Many Women

Average women's dimensions differ from standard furniture assumptions:

| Measurement | Average Woman | Standard Desk Design |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Height | 5'4" | 5'10" |
| Sitting eye height | 43-45" | 48-52" |
| Forearm length | 9-10" | 11-12" |
| Hip width | 14-15" | 12-13" |

This mismatch leads to:
- Reaching up to keyboards (shoulder strain)
- Looking up at monitors (neck strain)
- Feet dangling (back strain)
- Chairs too deep (poor support)

---

## Quick Ergonomic Check

Take 30 seconds to assess your current setup:

- [ ] Feet flat on floor (or footrest)?
- [ ] Knees at roughly 90 degrees?
- [ ] Back supported by chair?
- [ ] Elbows at roughly 90 degrees?
- [ ] Monitor at eye level?
- [ ] Screen about arm's length away?
- [ ] Shoulders relaxed (not hunched)?

**If you checked fewer than 5:** Your setup needs attention.

## The Complete Checklist

### Chair Setup

**Seat Height**
- [ ] Feet flat on floor (or on footrest)
- [ ] Thighs parallel to floor or slightly sloping down
- [ ] About 2-3 finger-widths between seat edge and back of knees

**How to adjust:** If your chair doesn't go low enough (common for women under 5'5"), use a footrest to bring the floor up to you.

**Seat Depth**
- [ ] Full thigh supported on seat
- [ ] Back can still reach the backrest
- [ ] 2-3 fingers between seat edge and back of knees

**How to adjust:** Many chairs are too deep for women. Use a lumbar pillow to bring the backrest forward, or look for chairs with adjustable seat depth.

**Backrest**
- [ ] Supports the natural curve of your lower back
- [ ] You can sit fully back while working
- [ ] Not pushing you forward

**Lumbar support:** If your chair lacks good lumbar support, add a rolled towel or lumbar pillow. Position it at the small of your back—typically lower than most built-in supports are placed.

**Armrests**
- [ ] Allow shoulders to relax down
- [ ] Elbows supported at 90 degrees
- [ ] Don't bump the desk (preventing you from pulling in)

**If armrests don't fit:** It's often better to remove them than to use poorly fitting armrests. Many women find chairs more comfortable without armrests.

---

### Desk Setup

**Desk Height**
- [ ] Elbows at 90 degrees when typing
- [ ] Forearms roughly parallel to floor
- [ ] Wrists straight (not bent up or down)

**Standard desk height (29-30") is often too high for women.** Solutions:
- Keyboard tray that lowers keyboard position
- Adjustable height desk
- Higher chair with footrest
- Keyboard on pullout drawer

**Desktop Space**
- [ ] Frequently used items within easy reach
- [ ] Phone on non-dominant side
- [ ] Documents near monitor (use document holder)
- [ ] Minimal clutter between you and keyboard

---

### Monitor Setup

**Height**
- [ ] Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- [ ] Looking slightly downward at center of screen (15-20°)
- [ ] Not craning neck up or down

**Most monitors are positioned too high.** If you can't lower your monitor:
- Remove monitor stand/pedestal
- Use lower desk or keyboard tray to raise yourself
- Avoid stacking on books/boxes that raise it further

**Distance**
- [ ] About arm's length away (18-24 inches)
- [ ] Can read text without leaning forward
- [ ] Far enough that you're not straining eyes

**If you wear bifocals or progressives:** Position monitor lower than standard guidelines to avoid tilting head back.

**Angle**
- [ ] Screen tilted slightly back (10-20°)
- [ ] No glare visible on screen
- [ ] Perpendicular to windows (not facing or with back to windows)

**Multiple Monitors**
- [ ] Primary monitor directly in front
- [ ] Secondary monitor angled toward you
- [ ] If using equally, position with seam at center and angle both in

---

### Keyboard and Mouse

**Keyboard Position**
- [ ] Directly in front of you
- [ ] Centered on the letters (not the whole keyboard)
- [ ] At height allowing straight wrists
- [ ] Keyboard legs folded down (flat)

**Most people position keyboard too far away** and reach forward, rounding shoulders.

**Mouse Position**
- [ ] Right next to keyboard
- [ ] At same height as keyboard
- [ ] Can reach without extending elbow

**Mouse size matters:** Standard mice are often too large for women's hands. Consider a compact or ergonomic mouse designed for smaller hands.

**Wrist Position**
- [ ] Wrists straight (not bent up or down)
- [ ] No pressure on wrists while typing
- [ ] Wrist rest used only for resting, not while actively typing

---

### Laptop-Specific Ergonomics

Laptops are ergonomically challenging because the screen and keyboard are connected. You can optimize the screen OR the keyboard, but not both.

**Best solutions:**

1. **External keyboard + raise laptop** (most ergonomic)
   - Place laptop on stand at eye level
   - Use external keyboard at proper height
   - Use external mouse

2. **External monitor + use laptop keyboard**
   - Connect to external monitor at eye level
   - Laptop becomes keyboard at desk level

3. **Working on laptop only** (least ergonomic)
   - Position laptop so you can see screen without craning
   - Take frequent breaks
   - Use a laptop stand to improve angle

---

### Lighting and Vision

**Overhead lighting**
- [ ] Not creating glare on screen
- [ ] Sufficient for reading documents
- [ ] Not directly above creating shadows

**Task lighting**
- [ ] Light source for reading documents
- [ ] Positioned to not create glare
- [ ] Adjustable

**Eye breaks**
Follow the 20-20-20 rule:
- Every 20 minutes
- Look at something 20 feet away
- For 20 seconds

## Special Situations

### If You're Under 5'4"

- Keyboard tray is almost essential
- Footrest is essential
- Look for "petite" chair options
- Consider compact keyboard to reduce reach

See our guide: [Ergonomics for Short Women](/activities/desk-work/short-women/)

### If You're Over 5'8"

- May need desk height raiser
- Standard chairs may be too shallow
- Look for chairs with adjustable seat depth

See our guide: [Ergonomics for Tall Women](/activities/desk-work/tall-women/)

### If You're Pregnant

- Sit slightly reclined as belly grows
- Use additional lumbar support
- Elevate feet to reduce swelling
- Take more frequent breaks
- Consider sit-stand desk for position variety

### If You're Breastfeeding

- Create space for pumping with proper posture
- Don't hunch over pump
- Take breaks for stretching

### Working From Home

- Avoid couch and bed "offices"
- Kitchen table often needs modifications
- Consider investing in proper chair and setup
- See our [Home Office Guide](/activities/desk-work/home-office/)

---

## Movement Is Essential

No static posture—no matter how "perfect"—is good for 8 hours.

**Build in movement:**
- Stand every 30-60 minutes
- Walk meetings when possible
- Desk stretches every hour
- Consider sit-stand desk
- Take real lunch break away from desk

**Desk stretches:** See our [5-Minute Desk Stretches](/exercises/desk-stretches/)

## Budget-Friendly Fixes

Not everyone can buy new furniture. Here are low-cost solutions:

| Problem | Budget Solution |
|---------|-----------------|
| Monitor too low | Stack of books or box |
| Monitor too high | Remove stand, lower desk |
| Chair too high | Footrest (box, step, ream of paper) |
| No lumbar support | Rolled towel |
| Chair too deep | Pillow behind back |
| Keyboard too high | Add keyboard tray, or raise chair + footrest |
| No document holder | DIY with binder clips |

## Asking for Equipment at Work

Many employers provide ergonomic equipment upon request. Tips:

1. **Start with a request, not complaint**
2. **Be specific** about what you need
3. **Cite ergonomics** and productivity benefits
4. **Offer to try inexpensive solutions first**
5. **Request formal ergonomic assessment** if available

Sample language: "I've noticed some discomfort that seems related to my workstation setup. Could I get a keyboard tray and footrest to better fit my height? These items should help me work more comfortably and productively."
