# Reading Posture: Protect Your Body While You Read

> **Read Without Pain:** Whether you prefer physical books or e-readers, how you position yourself while reading matters for your neck and back.

---

## The Problem

Reading often leads to:
- Looking down for extended periods
- Hunching over books
- Unsupported positions
- Neck and upper back strain

---

## Better Reading Positions

### In a Chair

**Best approach:**
- Bring book up, not head down
- Use pillow or cushion to support book
- Sit back with support
- Take breaks

### On the Couch

**Avoid:** Lying with head propped awkwardly

**Better:**
- Sitting upright with back support
- Book supported by pillow
- Feet up if comfortable
- Not twisted

### In Bed

**Avoid:** Flat on back with head only propped (strains neck)

**Better:**
- Sit up with pillows behind back
- Or side-lying with proper support
- Book at eye level if possible
- Keep sessions short

---

## Tips for All Reading

1. Hold book higher, not head lower
2. Support the book's weight
3. Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
4. Stretch neck and shoulders
5. Good lighting (reduces leaning forward)

## E-Readers and Tablets

**Advantages:**
- Lighter than books
- Adjustable text size
- Can use stands

**Apply same principles:**
- Raise to eye level
- Use stand when possible
- Don't hold in lap and look down
