# Speed Training Posture

Speed training develops running velocity. Proper posture enables efficient, powerful movement.

## Acceleration

### Start Position

**Explosive start:**
- Staggered stance
- Forward lean
- Arms ready
- Core tight
- Loaded for explosion

### First Steps

**Driving out:**
- Powerful push
- Low angle
