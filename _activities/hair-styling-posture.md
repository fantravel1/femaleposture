# Hair Styling Posture

Hair styling requires sustained arm elevation and tool use. Proper posture prevents the shoulder and arm fatigue common to this routine.

## Arms Overhead

### Blow Drying

**Extended arm work:**
- Switch hands regularly
- Lower arms periodically
- Section hair efficiently
- Take breaks
- Shoulder awareness

### Curling and Straightening

**Hot tool use:**
- Safe technique
- Arm rest when possible
- Switch hands if able
- Efficient sections
- Posture awareness

## Body Position

### Standing Styling

**Mirror work:**
- Face mirror directly
- Upright posture
- Arms at comfortable angles
- Core engaged
- Stable stance

### Seated Styling

**Chair positioning:**
- Proper height
- Mirror at eye level
- Arms supported when possible
- Comfortable duration
- Position changes

## Shoulder Care

### Preventing Fatigue

**During styling:**
- Frequent breaks
- Arm lowering
- Shoulder rolls
- Stretching between sections
- Efficient technique

### Post-Styling

**After routine:**
- Shoulder stretches
- Arm stretches
- Neck movements
- Full recovery
- Prevent cumulative strain

## Long Hair Considerations

### Extended Styling

**More demanding:**
- Plan sections efficiently
- More breaks needed
- Tool weight matters
- Seated option
- Helper if available

Good hair styling posture protects your shoulders and arms through this regular beauty routine.
