# Sitting Posture Guide

> **You Sit More Than You Think:** Average adults sit 8-10 hours daily. How you sit affects everything—learn to do it well.

---

## Why Sitting Posture Matters

### The Sitting Problem

**Modern life means:**
- Hours at desks
- Time in cars
- Meals seated
- Entertainment seated
- Cumulative strain

### What Poor Sitting Does

**Over time:**
- Lower back pain
- Neck and shoulder tension
- Hip tightness
- Circulation issues
- Postural changes

---

## Basic Sitting Principles

### The Foundation

**Key elements:**
- Sit bones on seat
- Spine in natural curves
- Feet supported
- Arms relaxed
- Head balanced

### What "Good" Sitting Feels Like

**Should be:**
- Relatively effortless
- Sustainable
- Not rigid or forced
- Comfortable for reasonable duration

---

## Optimal Seated Position

### Lower Body

**Feet:**
- Flat on floor
- Or on footrest
- Not dangling
- Hip-width apart or comfortable

**Knees:**
- About 90 degrees (or slightly more)
- At or slightly below hip level
- Not pressed together or spread extremely

**Hips:**
- At back of seat
- Sit bones on surface
- Pelvis relatively neutral
- Weight distributed evenly

### Upper Body

**Spine:**
- Natural curves maintained
- Not flattened or exaggerated
- Lower back curve present (lumbar)
- Upper back gently rounded

**Shoulders:**
- Relaxed, not elevated
- Not rolled forward
- Dropped away from ears
- Arms hang naturally

**Head:**
- Balanced on spine
- Ears over shoulders
- Chin neutral (not jutting forward)
- Eyes look forward naturally

---

## Chair Fit

### Chair Height

**Correct height:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Thighs parallel to floor
- Knees at about 90 degrees

**Too high:**
- Feet dangle
- Pressure behind thighs
- Strain

**Too low:**
- Knees above hips
- Lower back rounds
- Hip flexor issues

### Seat Depth

**Correct depth:**
- Back touches chair back
- Space behind knees (2-3 fingers)
- Full thigh support

**Too deep:**
- Can't reach back
- Perching on edge
- No back support

### Lumbar Support

**What it does:**
- Supports lower back curve
- Reduces strain
- Maintains neutral spine
- Essential for long sitting

**If chair lacks it:**
- Add lumbar roll
- Rolled towel
- Cushion
- Position matters

## Different Sitting Scenarios

### At a Desk

**Work setup:**

- Variation is essential
- Static positions strain
- Movement prevents problems

- Shift position
- Stand briefly
- Move somehow
- Reset
