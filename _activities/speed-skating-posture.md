# Speed Skating Posture

Speed skating demands extreme aerodynamic positioning. Proper form enables maximum velocity.

## Basic Position

### Low Stance

**Speed position:**
- Very low crouch
- Thighs near parallel
- Deep knee bend
- Core engaged
- Aerodynamic

### Back Position

**Upper body:**
- Flat back
- Horizontal to ice
- Head forward
- Eyes ahead
- Streamlined

## Arm Position

### One Arm Back

**Aerodynamic:**
- One arm behind back
- Other arm swings
- Alternate occasionally
- Reduce drag
- Personal preference

### Arm Swing

**Power addition:**
- Coordinate with stride
- Add momentum
- Natural rhythm
- Efficient motion
- Strategic use

## Stride Technique

### Push Phase

**Power generation:**
- Full leg extension
- Push to side
- Powerful push-off
- Maximum power
- Efficient angle

### Recovery

**Leg return:**
- Quick recovery
- Efficient motion
- Preparation for next
- No wasted motion
- Rhythmic pattern

## Turns

### Corner Technique

**Banking:**
- Crossover steps
- Leaning into turn
- Maintained speed
- Efficient pattern
- Practice essential

## Long vs Short Track

### Differences

**Event specifics:**
- Long track aerodynamics
- Short track agility
- Different demands
- Specialized training
- Event focus

Good speed skating posture maximizes velocity through optimal aerodynamics.
