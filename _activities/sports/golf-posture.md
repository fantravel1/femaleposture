# Golf and Posture

> **Better Posture, Better Game:** Golf requires and develops specific postural demands. Good address position and swing mechanics depend on a healthy spine.

---

## Posture at Address

### The Setup

Good golf posture includes:
- Hip hinge (not back bending)
- Neutral spine
- Slight knee bend
- Weight balanced
- Arms hanging naturally

### Common Faults

**Too rounded:**
- Hunched over ball
- Limits rotation
- Strains back

**Too arched:**
- Excessive lordosis
- Stresses spine on swing

---

## How Golf Affects Posture

### The Rotation Challenge

Golf swing involves:
- Repeated rotation one direction
- Asymmetric loading
- Shear forces on spine
- End-range positions

### Common Golf-Related Issues

- Lower back pain (very common)
- Hip tightness
- Shoulder issues
- Neck strain
- One-sided muscle development

---

## Preventing Golf-Related Problems

### Balanced Training

**Off-course work:**
- Rotation both directions
- Core strengthening
- Hip mobility
- Upper back flexibility

### Before Playing

1. Full warm-up (not just practice swings)
2. Dynamic stretches
3. Hip circles
4. Trunk rotations (both ways)
5. Arm swings
6. Gradual swing progression

### After Playing

1. Stretch hip flexors
2. Trunk rotation stretches
3. Chest and shoulder stretches
4. Lower back stretches
5. Cool-down walk

## Key Exercises for Golfers

### Hip Mobility

**Why it matters:**
- Power from hips
- Reduces back strain
- Improves rotation

**Exercises:**
- Hip circles
- 90-90 stretch
- Hip flexor stretches
- Pigeon pose

### Core Stability

**For swing control:**
- Dead bug
- Bird-dog
- Pallof press (anti-rotation)
- Planks

### Thoracic Mobility

**For rotation:**
- Thread the needle
- Open books
- Foam roller extensions
- Seated rotations

### Glute Strength

**For power:**
- Glute bridges
- Single-leg work
- Squats
- Lunges

---

## Addressing Common Issues

### Lower Back Pain

**The most common golf injury:**

**Prevention:**
- Core strengthening
- Hip mobility
- Proper warm-up
- Good swing mechanics
- Don't over-practice

**Management:**
- Reduce playing frequency
- Focus on form
- Seek professional instruction
- Physical therapy if persistent

### Hip Tightness

**From:**
- Rotation demands
- Weight shift patterns
- Prolonged sitting (traveling to course)

**Address with:**
- Regular hip stretching
- Hip rotation exercises
- Pre-round mobility work

---

## Improving Golf Through Posture

### Better Rotation

- Thoracic mobility allows fuller turn
- Hip mobility allows proper weight shift
- Better rotation = more power

### Consistent Swing

- Good posture = consistent setup
- Body awareness improves mechanics
- Less compensatory movement

### Injury Prevention

- Strong, mobile body handles demands
- Reduced strain on vulnerable areas
- Longer playing career

---

## For Women Golfers

### Considerations

- May need modified equipment
- Flexibility is often an asset
- Strength training beneficial
- Address any unique biomechanics

### Common Patterns

- Often have good flexibility
- May need more strength work
- Core stability important
- Don't overlook warm-up

---

## Age and Golf

### As You Get Older

- Warm-up becomes more important
- Flexibility work essential
- Strength training helpful
- Recovery time increases
- Consider shorter rounds if needed

### Staying in the Game

- Regular exercise off course
- Mobility maintenance
- Strength preservation
- Smart scheduling

---

## Equipment Considerations

### Club Fitting

- Proper length reduces strain
- Appropriate lie angle
- Weight suited to you
- Consider getting fitted

### Cart vs. Walking

- Walking is better exercise
- Push carts reduce carrying strain
- Riding has its place
- Consider your body's needs
