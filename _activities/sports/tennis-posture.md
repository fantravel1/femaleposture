# Tennis and Posture

> **Play Without Pain:** Tennis is great exercise but can create muscle imbalances if you don't address them. Learn how to protect your posture while enjoying the sport.

---

## How Tennis Affects Posture

### The One-Sided Challenge

Tennis is asymmetric:
- Dominant arm does most work
- Repeated rotation one direction
- One shoulder works harder
- Can create muscle imbalances

### Common Issues

- Shoulder asymmetry
- Trunk rotation imbalance
- Tight chest on playing side
- Lower back strain
- Hip imbalances

---

## Preventing Imbalances

### Balance Your Training

**Off-court exercises:**
- Work non-dominant side
- Include pulling exercises (rows)
- Stretch playing-side muscles
- Strengthen opposite rotation

### Upper Body Balance

**Strengthen:**
- Upper back (both sides)
- Rotator cuff (both sides)
- Core (anti-rotation)

**Stretch:**
- Chest (especially playing side)
- Shoulder (playing side)
- Lat (playing side)

### Core and Rotation

**Why it matters:**
- Power comes from core
- One-directional rotation is repetitive
- Need opposite rotation work

**Exercises:**
- Rotational exercises both directions
- Anti-rotation holds
- Cable chops both ways

## Common Tennis Posture Problems

### Shoulder Imbalance

**Signs:**
- One shoulder sits forward
- Asymmetric posture
- Tightness on one side

**Address with:**
- Chest stretches (playing side)
- Upper back strengthening (both sides)
- Rotator cuff work
- Shoulder symmetry awareness

### Lower Back Pain

**Causes:**
- Rotation strain
- Extension on serves
- Weak core

**Prevent with:**
- Core strengthening
- Hip mobility
- Proper serving mechanics
- Adequate warm-up

### Hip Tightness

**From:**
- Lunging repeatedly
- Quick direction changes
- One-sided movement patterns

**Address with:**
- Hip flexor stretches
- Hip rotation work
- Glute strengthening
- Mobility routine

## Before and After Playing

### Pre-Tennis Warm-Up

2. Shoulder stretch
3. Trunk rotation stretches
4. Hip flexor stretches
5. Forearm stretches
6. Cool-down walk

## Technique and Posture

### Serving

- Avoid excessive back arch
- Use legs for power
- Core engaged
- Proper follow-through

### Groundstrokes

- Rotate through core
- Recover to neutral
- Don't over-rotate
- Balanced stance

### General

- Good athletic posture
- Stay light on feet
- Use whole body, not just arm
- Return to balanced position

---

## Equipment Considerations

### Racquet

- Appropriate weight
- Proper grip size
- String tension suited to you
- Equipment affects strain on body

### Shoes

- Court-appropriate footwear
- Good lateral support
- Replace when worn

---

## Strengthening for Tennis Players

### Weekly Routine

**2-3x per week:**
1. Rows — 3x12 (upper back)
2. Push-ups — 3x10-15 (balance)
3. Rotator cuff exercises — 2x15
4. Core work (planks, rotations) — 2-3 sets
5. Single-leg exercises — 3x10 each
6. Hip exercises — 2x15 each

---

## Age Considerations

### For Recreational Players

- Warm up thoroughly
- Don't overdo frequency
- Listen to your body
- Recovery between sessions

### For Senior Players

- Extra warm-up time
- Consider doubles (less running)
