# Yoga for Desk Workers: 15-Minute Office Recovery Routine

> **The Problem:** Hours of sitting at a desk creates a predictable pattern: tight hip flexors, rounded shoulders, forward head, compressed spine. This yoga routine specifically targets these issues.

---

## What Desk Work Does to Your Body

**Tight areas:**
- Hip flexors (front of hips)
- Chest and front shoulders
- Upper traps (neck/shoulders)
- Hamstrings (surprisingly)

**Weak/lengthened areas:**
- Upper back muscles
- Glutes
- Deep core
- Deep neck flexors

**The result:** Rounded shoulders, forward head, lower back pain, neck tension, and general stiffness.
