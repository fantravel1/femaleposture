## Poses to Approach with Caution

These poses can aggravate back pain if done incorrectly:

### Forward Folds (Uttanasana, Paschimottanasana)

**The issue:** Rounding the lower back under load

**Safer approach:**
- Bend knees generously
- Hinge from hips, not lower back
- Keep back flat, not rounded
- Use blocks under hands
- Or skip during flare-ups

### Deep Backbends (Wheel, Camel)

**The issue:** Compressing lower back

**Safer approach:**
- Start with gentler backbends (Sphinx, Cobra)
- Focus on length, not depth
- Engage core and glutes before bending
- Skip during acute pain

### Seated Twists (Deep Versions)

**The issue:** Can stress disc if done aggressively

**Safer approach:**
- Keep twists gentle
- Twist from mid-back, not lower back
- Never force range of motion
- Stop if it causes pain

### Strong Core Poses (Boat, Plank Variations)

**The issue:** Can strain back if core is weak

**Safer approach:**
- Modify (knees bent in boat, knees down in plank)
- Build strength gradually
- Stop if back hurts

## Styles of Yoga for Back Pain

**Best choices:**
- **Gentle/Restorative yoga:** Slow, supported poses
- **Yin yoga:** Long-held gentle stretches
- **Hatha yoga:** Traditional, often slower-paced
- **Therapeutic yoga:** Specifically designed for issues

**Approach with caution:**

## When Yoga Isn't Enough

See a healthcare provider if:
- Pain persists despite gentle practice

- You have numbness or tingling
- Pain radiates down your legs
- You have weakness in legs or feet
- Pain is severe or constant

Yoga can complement medical treatment but may not replace it for significant issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can yoga make back pain worse?

Yes, if you do the wrong poses or do them incorrectly. Choose back-friendly poses, practice gently, and stop anything that hurts.

### How often should I practice yoga for back pain?

Daily gentle practice is ideal. Even 10-15 minutes helps. If attending classes, 2-3 times per week is good.

### Is hot yoga good for back pain?

Approach cautiously. Heat increases flexibility but can mask pain signals, leading to overstretching. Warm (not hot) environments may be safer.

### Should I do yoga during a back pain flare-up?

During acute, severe pain, rest is often better. As pain subsides, very gentle movements (like cat-cow) can help. Listen to your body.
