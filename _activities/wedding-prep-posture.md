# Wedding Posture Prep

You've chosen the dress, booked the venue, and planned every detail. But have you thought about how you'll carry yourself when all eyes are on you?

Your posture in wedding photos lasts forever. The way you walk down the aisle sets the tone for the ceremony. And how you hold yourself throughout the day affects not just photos, but how you feel.

This guide gives you a practical timeline to prepare your posture for your wedding day.

## Why Wedding Posture Matters

### The Photo Reality

Wedding photos capture you from every angle:
- Straight-on altar shots
- Side profiles walking the aisle
- Back shots during the ceremony
- Candids throughout the day
- Detail shots highlighting your dress

Poor posture shows in all of them. Good posture elevates every frame.

### The Physical Demands

A wedding day requires:
- Standing for hours in heels
- Maintaining composure under attention
- Moving gracefully in a dress you're not used to
- Endurance from morning prep to late reception
- Repeat photo poses without slumping

### The Confidence Factor

How you carry yourself affects:
- How confident you feel
- How present you can be
- Your energy throughout the day
- Your genuine enjoyment of the moment

Posture prep is self-care, not vanity.

### Walking the Aisle
