# Cycling Posture: Bike Fit and Alignment

> **Ride Pain-Free:** Good cycling posture depends on proper bike fit and body position. Get it right, and cycling can be sustainable for years. Get it wrong, and pain often follows.

---

## Why Cycling Posture Matters

Poor cycling posture can cause:
- Lower back pain
- Neck pain
- Shoulder and wrist issues
- Knee problems
- Numbness in hands or seat area
- Reduced power and efficiency

Good posture on the bike:
- Prevents injuries
- Improves power transfer
- Reduces fatigue
- Makes riding more enjoyable

## Elements of Good Cycling Posture

### Spine Position

**Ideal:**
- Flat back, not excessively rounded
- Pelvis tilted forward naturally
- Core engaged for support
- Slight curve in lower back maintained

**Avoid:**
- Severely hunched back
- Collapsed lower back
- Rigid, locked position

### Head and Neck

**Ideal:**
- Head in line with spine
- Eyes looking forward
- Neck not overly extended

**Avoid:**
- Craning neck excessively
- Looking down at front wheel
- Head drooping from fatigue

### Shoulders and Arms

**Ideal:**
- Shoulders relaxed, not shrugged
- Elbows slightly bent
- Weight supported but not excessive on hands

**Avoid:**
- Locked elbows
- Shoulders up near ears
- Excessive weight on hands

### Hips and Pelvis

**Ideal:**
- Pelvis tilted forward
- Sitting on sit bones
- Stable base on saddle

**Avoid:**
- Pelvis tilted too far back
- Rocking side to side excessively
- Perching on front of saddle

## Bike Fit Basics

### Saddle Height

**Correct:**
- Slight bend in knee at bottom of pedal stroke (25-35 degrees)
- Hips don't rock side to side
- Can pedal smoothly

**Too high:**
- Rocking hips
- Reaching for pedals
- Knee pain

**Too low:**
- Knee too bent at bottom
- Quad fatigue
- Potential knee issues

### Saddle Position (Fore-Aft)

**Correct:**
- Knee over pedal spindle when crank is horizontal
- Balanced weight distribution

**Too far forward:**
- Excessive pressure on hands
- Knee issues possible

**Too far back:**
- Overreaching
- Hip strain

### Handlebar Height

**Higher handlebars:**
- More upright position
- Less strain on back and neck
- Better for recreational riding
- May reduce power slightly

**Lower handlebars:**
- More aerodynamic
- More aggressive position
- Requires more flexibility
- Common in racing

### Reach to Handlebars

**Correct:**
- Comfortable arm position
- Slight elbow bend
- Relaxed shoulders
- Not overreaching

**Too far:**
- Locked elbows
- Strained shoulders
- Excessive weight on hands

**Too close:**
- Cramped position
- Knees hit arms
- Hunched upper body

## Bike Types and Posture

### Road Bikes

- More aggressive, forward position
- Lower handlebars
- Requires more flexibility
- Higher performance, but more demanding

### Hybrid/Fitness Bikes

- More upright position
- Moderate reach
- Good balance of comfort and efficiency
- Suitable for most recreational riders

### Mountain Bikes

- Relatively upright
- Wider handlebars
- Position varies by terrain
- More dynamic posture

### Comfort/Cruiser Bikes

- Very upright
- Minimal forward lean
- Easier on back and neck
- Less efficient but comfortable

### Stationary/Indoor Bikes

- Fit is still important
- Adjust seat and handlebars
- Same principles apply

## Common Cycling Posture Problems

### Lower Back Pain

**Causes:**
- Poor saddle position
- Excessive reach
- Weak core
- Tight hip flexors
- Too much time in aggressive position

**Solutions:**
- Adjust bike fit
- Strengthen core
- Stretch hip flexors
- Consider more upright position
- Take breaks on long rides

### Neck Pain

**Causes:**
- Looking up too much
- Handlebars too low
- Helmet position
- Core fatigue causing slumping

**Solutions:**
- Raise handlebars
- Strengthen neck muscles
- Check helmet fit
- Take micro-breaks to move neck

### Numbness in Hands

**Causes:**
- Too much weight on hands
- Poor handlebar angle
- Gripping too tightly
- Nerve compression

**Solutions:**
- Adjust handlebar height/reach
- Padded gloves
- Change hand positions frequently
- Relax grip

### Knee Pain

**Causes:**
- Saddle too high or low
- Foot position on pedals
- Sudden increase in training

**Solutions:**
- Check saddle height

## Exercises for Cyclists

### Core Strengthening

Essential for supporting spine on bike:
- Planks
- Dead bug
- Bird-dog
- Bridges

### Hip Flexor Stretching

Cyclists often have tight hip flexors:
- Half-kneeling hip flexor stretch
- Couch stretch
- Pigeon pose

### Upper Back/Thoracic Mobility

Counter the flexed position:
- Thoracic extension
- Cat-cow
- Thread the needle
- Foam rolling upper back

### Neck Stretches

Relieve cycling-related neck tension:
- Neck rotations
- Upper trap stretch
- Chin tucks

### Glute Strengthening

Power and pelvic stability:
- Glute bridges
- Clamshells
- Single-leg exercises

## During the Ride

### Position Checks

Periodically assess:
- Am I hunching?
- Are my shoulders relaxed?
- Is my core engaged?
- Am I gripping too tight?

### Movement

- Change hand positions regularly
- Stand periodically
- Shift position on saddle
- Roll shoulders

### Breaks

- On long rides, get off the bike
- Stretch back and hips
- Walk around
- Reset posture
