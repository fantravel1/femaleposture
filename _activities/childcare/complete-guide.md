# Childcare Posture Guide

> **Caring for Little Ones Is Physical:** Children need to be lifted, carried, and played with at their level. This guide helps you protect your body while caring for kids.

---

## The Physical Reality

### Why Childcare Is Hard on Bodies

- **Repeated lifting** - Dozens of times daily
- **Awkward positions** - Everything at child height
- **Carrying** - Often on one hip
- **Quick movements** - Chasing, catching, grabbing
- **Floor time** - Extended periods down low
- **Equipment** - Car seats, strollers, high chairs

### Common Injuries

- Lower back strain (most common)
- Shoulder problems
- Neck pain
- Wrist issues
- Knee problems

---

## Lifting Children

### Infants

**From crib or floor:**
1. Get close to baby
2. Widen stance
3. Squat or half-kneel
4. Bring baby close to chest
5. Stand using legs

**From car seat:**
1. Get as close as possible
2. Knee on seat if needed
3. Bring baby close before lifting
4. Core engaged

### Toddlers (1-3 Years)

**The highest-risk period** - Heavy and frequent lifting

**From floor:**
1. Squat to their level
2. Have them face you
3. Encourage them to "help" by holding on
4. Lift with legs, keeping close

**When they want up:**
- Teach them to come to you
- Squat to their level
- Don't bend at waist and scoop

### Preschoolers

- Usually don't need lifting
- Encourage climbing up
- Use step stools
- Lift only when necessary

---

## Carrying Children

### The Hip Carry Problem

**Why it's so common:**
- Leaves one hand free
- Kids like it
- Feels natural

**Why it's a problem:**
- All weight on one side
- Spine curves to compensate
- Creates muscle imbalances
- Repeated daily = injury

### Better Carrying Options

**Center carry:**
- Child facing you
- Weight centered
- Both arms supporting
- Less strain

**Switch sides:**
- If you must hip carry
- Switch every few minutes
- Build awareness

**Use carriers:**
- Especially for long periods
- See [Baby Carrying Posture](/tools/baby-carrying-posture/)

### Duration Limits

- Minimize carrying time
- Encourage walking (age-appropriate)
- Use strollers
- Set child down frequently

---

## Floor Time

### Getting Down

**Don't just drop:**
- Lower controlled
- Use furniture for support
- Go to one knee first
- Then to floor

### Sitting Positions

**Vary your position:**
- Cross-legged (switch which leg on top)
- Side-sitting (switch sides)
- One knee up
- Kneeling with cushion
- Using low chair/cushion

### Extended Floor Play

- Change positions every 10-15 minutes
- Use cushions under knees
- Support for sitting
- Get up periodically

### Getting Up

- Use hands/furniture for support
- Come to one knee first
- Then stand
- Don't rush

---

## Diaper Changing

### The Repetitive Problem

**Multiple times daily = significant strain**

**At changing table:**
- Table at waist height
- Stand close
- Face the table squarely
- Everything within reach
- Don't twist to grab supplies

**On floor/bed:**
- Kneel rather than bend
- Cushion under knees
- Get supplies first
- Change positions with different diapers

---

## Feeding Time

### Infants

**Bottle feeding:**
- Support your arm (pillow)
- Sit in supportive chair
- Switch arms
- Don't hunch over baby

**Breastfeeding:**
- See [Breastfeeding Positions](/tools/breastfeeding-positions-guide/)

### Toddlers

**At high chair:**
- Kneel or sit to feed
- Don't bend over them
- Bring food to their level

**Cleanup:**
- Squat to clean face/hands
- Squat to clean floor
- Use long-handled tools when possible

---

## Bath Time

### Bathing in Tub

**The challenge:**
- Leaning over tub edge
- Sustained awkward position
- Wet, slippery

**Solutions:**
