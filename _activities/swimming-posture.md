# Swimming Posture

Swimming requires unique body positioning—horizontal alignment in water demands different awareness than land-based activities. Understanding proper swimming posture improves technique and prevents injury.

## Water Body Position

### Horizontal Alignment

**Proper position:**
- Streamlined body
- Head neutral
- Hips at surface
- Core engaged
- Relaxed muscles

### Common Errors

**What to avoid:**
- Head too high
- Hips sinking
- Asymmetric stroke
- Tension in muscles
- Poor breathing position

## Stroke-Specific Posture

### Freestyle

**Key positions:**
- Long body line
- Rotating torso
- High elbow catch
- Neutral head
- Relaxed kick

### Backstroke

**Alignment focus:**
- Flat body position
- Chin neutral
- Hip rotation
- Even stroke
- Relaxed shoulders

### Breaststroke

**Body mechanics:**
- Streamlined glide
- Proper head position
- Symmetrical movement
- Hip flexibility
- Timing coordination

### Butterfly

**Demanding form:**
- Core-driven undulation
- Shoulder flexibility
- Simultaneous arm recovery
- Coordinated kick
- Breath timing

## Women-Specific Considerations

### Body Differences

**Female considerations:**
- Buoyancy patterns
- Shoulder flexibility
- Hip stability
- Core strength needs
- Suit considerations

### Training Adaptations

**Adjustments:**
- Shoulder protection
- Core emphasis
- Hip mobility work
- Breathing efficiency
- Recovery attention

Swimming with proper posture maximizes efficiency in the water while protecting your body from overuse injuries.
