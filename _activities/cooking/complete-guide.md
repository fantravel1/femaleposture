# Cooking Posture Guide

> **Kitchen Time Adds Up:** Whether you're a home cook or preparing three meals daily, time in the kitchen means time standing, chopping, and bending. Good technique protects your body.

---

## Kitchen Posture Challenges

### Common Issues

- **Standing on hard floors** for extended periods
- **Counter height** often wrong for your height
- **Reaching** into cabinets and appliances
- **Bending** into ovens and dishwashers
- **Repetitive motions** chopping, stirring
- **Looking down** at work surface

### Why It Matters

- Daily activity compounds strain
- Kitchen injuries are common
- Back and shoulder pain from cooking is real
- Prevention is easier than recovery

---

## Counter Height Problems

### The Challenge

Standard counter height (36") is designed for someone about 5'7" - not everyone.

**Too low:**
- Forward bending
- Back strain
- Shoulder elevation

**Too high:**
- Reaching up
- Shoulder tension
- Wrist strain

### Solutions

**If counter is too low:**
- Cutting boards on risers
- Stand at wider stance (lowers you slightly)
- Use island/higher surface when possible
- Consider counter modifications

**If counter is too high:**
- Stand on platform or step
- Use lower work surface
- Sit at counter height stool
- Modify if possible

---

## Standing in the Kitchen

### Long Periods on Your Feet

**Basic standing posture:**
- Weight even on both feet
- Knees soft, not locked
- Core gently engaged
- Shoulders back
- Head balanced

### Make Standing Easier

**Anti-fatigue mat:**
- Essential at sink and stove
- Cushions impact
- Encourages micro-movements
- Replace when worn

**Footwear:**
- Supportive shoes (not barefoot)
- Cushioned insoles
- No heels or slides

**Shift and move:**
- Don't freeze in place
- Alternate weight between legs
- Step side to side
- Use one foot on low step

---

## Chopping and Prep Work

### Cutting Position

**Setup:**
- Board at comfortable height
- Elbows at about 90 degrees
- Close to the counter

**Technique:**
- Let knife do the work
- Relaxed grip
- Move from shoulder, not just wrist
- Stand squarely facing board

**Breaks:**
- Every 10-15 minutes
- Roll wrists
- Shoulder circles
- Step back and stretch

### Common Mistakes

- Hunching over
- Reaching too far
- Death-grip on knife
- Staying frozen in position

---

## At the Stove

### Stirring and Monitoring

**Position:**
- Stand close
- Don't lean over hot surfaces
- Arm moves from shoulder
- Switch hands when possible

**For tall pots:**
- May need to reach up
- Bring to front of stove
- Use longer utensils
- Don't strain

### Lifting Heavy Pots

**Technique:**
- Get close
- Grip securely with both hands
- Lift with legs if heavy
- Don't twist while carrying
- Set down carefully

**When it's too heavy:**
- Don't be a hero
- Ladle out first to reduce weight
- Get help
- Use smaller portions

---

## Using the Oven

### Reaching In

**The bend-and-reach challenge:**
- Heavy items at arm's length
- Hot surfaces
- Awkward angles

**Better technique:**
- Open door fully
- Squat or use half-kneel
- Pull rack out before lifting
- Assess weight before moving

### Checking Food

- Don't bend at waist repeatedly
- Squat briefly
- Install oven light if needed
- Use timer rather than constant checking

---

## Refrigerator and Pantry

### Low Shelves

**Problem:**
- Bending to reach
- Repeated throughout day

**Solutions:**
- Store frequently used items higher
- Squat instead of bending
- Organize for efficiency
- Pull items forward for access

### High Shelves

- Use step stool (always)
- Don't reach and strain
- Store heavy items lower
- Light items up high

---

## Dishwashing

### At the Sink

**If sink is too low:**
- This is very common
- Causes forward bending
- Back strain develops

**Solutions:**
- Wide stance lowers you
- Place dishpan on elevated surface
- Take frequent breaks
- Consider dishwasher use

### Loading Dishwasher

**Technique:**
- Squat or half-kneel
- Don't bend at waist repeatedly
- Load without twisting
- Take breaks during large loads

---

## Small Appliances

### Counter Space

**Keep frequently used:**
- At accessible heights
- Easy to access
- Not requiring reaching

**Heavy appliances:**
- Store at counter level
- Don't lift from high or low
- Slide rather than lift when possible

---

## Multi-Hour Cooking

### For Big Meals or Prep

**Pace yourself:**
- Alternate tasks
- Sit when possible
- Standing and sitting mix
- Build in breaks

**Prep work:**
- Sit at table for some tasks
- Cut vegetables sitting down
- Assembly can be seated

### Recovery

- Stretching after long sessions
- Rest before evening
- Don't go from cooking straight to eating hunched over

---

## Kitchen Design Considerations

### If Renovating

**Think about:**
- Counter heights (adjustable or right for you)
- Multi-height work surfaces
- Easy-access storage
- Proper flooring

### Simple Modifications

- Anti-fatigue mats
- Step stools
- Drawer organizers (reduce reaching)
- Under-cabinet lighting (reduce leaning)

---

## Stretches for After Cooking

**Neck:**
- Tilts and turns
- 20 seconds each direction

**Shoulders:**
- Rolls
- Doorway stretch
- Behind-back clasp

**Back:**
- Standing back extension
- Cat-cow
- Side stretches

**Hips and legs:**
- Hip flexor stretch
- Calf stretch
- Quad stretch
