# Best Sleeping Positions for Spine Health

> **You spend a third of your life sleeping.** Your sleep position matters for posture, pain, and how you feel each morning. Here's what works best for different situations.

---

## Why Sleep Position Matters

During sleep:
- Muscles relax and can't actively support your spine
- You're in one position for hours at a time
- Spine can be stressed or supported based on alignment
- Tissue healing and recovery occurs

Poor sleep positioning can cause:
- Morning stiffness
- Waking pain
- Headaches
- Perpetuating daytime posture problems

## The Positions Ranked

### Best: Side Sleeping (with proper support)

**~69% of people naturally sleep on their side**

**Why it's good:**
- Keeps spine relatively neutral
- Good for breathing and circulation
- Reduces acid reflux symptoms
- Best for pregnancy

**How to optimize:**
- Pillow between knees (crucial!)
- Pillow height that fills space between ear and shoulder
- Slight knee bend (not fetal)
- Avoid curling into tight ball

**Pillow needs:**
- Thicker pillow than back sleepers need
- Should fill the space from shoulder to head
- Consider contour pillow for neck support

### Good: Back Sleeping (supine)

**~8% of people naturally sleep on their back**

**Why it's good:**
- Spine can rest in neutral alignment
- Evenly distributes body weight
- No pressure on face (good for skin)

**Why it can be problematic:**
- Can worsen sleep apnea and snoring
- May increase lower back curve (anterior tilt)
- Not recommended after first trimester of pregnancy

**How to optimize:**
- Pillow under knees (reduces lower back strain)
- Medium-loft pillow (not too thick)
- Avoid pillow that pushes head too far forward

### Worst: Stomach Sleeping (prone)

**~7% of people naturally sleep on their stomach**

**Why it's problematic:**
- Head turned to one side for hours (neck strain)
- Lower back often over-extended
- Difficult to keep spine neutral
- Pressure on jaw, face, shoulders

**If you can't change:**
- Very flat or no pillow under head
- Pillow under hips/pelvis (reduces lumbar extension)
- Try to gradually transition to side sleeping

## Choosing Your Pillow

### Side Sleepers

**Height:** Thick enough to fill shoulder-to-head gap
**Goal:** Keep head level with spine

**Test:** Lie on side—someone should see your spine roughly straight from behind.

### Back Sleepers

**Height:** Medium—supports natural neck curve without pushing head forward
**Goal:** Maintain cervical curve without flexing head forward

**Test:** Your chin should be level, not tilted up or down.

### Stomach Sleepers

**Height:** Very flat or no pillow
**Goal:** Minimize neck rotation stress

---

## Pillow Between Knees: Why It Matters

For side sleepers, a pillow between knees:

- Keeps pelvis neutral (prevents rotation)
- Reduces SI joint stress
- Decreases lower back strain
- Improves hip alignment

**What to use:**
- Dedicated knee pillow
- Regular pillow folded
- Body pillow for full-body support

---

## Special Situations

### For Lower Back Pain

**Best position:** Side sleeping with pillow between knees

**Back sleeping alternative:** Place pillow under knees to reduce lower back curve

**Avoid:** Stomach sleeping

### For Neck Pain

**Best position:** Back sleeping with properly fitted pillow

**Side sleeping:** Ensure pillow fills shoulder gap—too high or low worsens neck strain

**Key:** Avoid stomach sleeping entirely if neck pain is an issue

### During Pregnancy

**First trimester:** Any comfortable position

**Second/third trimester:**
- **Left side sleeping recommended** (optimal blood flow)
- Pillow between knees
- Pillow under belly for support
- Pillow behind back to prevent rolling onto back

See our [Pregnancy Sleep Guide](/life-stages/pregnancy/sleep-positions/)

### For Acid Reflux

**Best position:** Left side sleeping with head slightly elevated

**Why:** Keeps stomach below esophagus, reducing reflux

### For Sleep Apnea or Snoring

**Avoid:** Back sleeping (makes airways more likely to collapse)

**Best:** Side sleeping

**Consider:** Slightly elevated head position

## Mattress Matters

Your mattress affects posture too:

**Too soft:**
- Spine sags into curves
- Can worsen back pain
- Common culprit in morning stiffness

**Too firm:**
- Creates pressure points
- Doesn't accommodate curves
- Can cause hip and shoulder pain

**Just right:**
- Supports curves without sagging
- Allows hips and shoulders to sink slightly
- Keeps spine roughly neutral

**General guidance:**
- Side sleepers often need slightly softer to accommodate curves
- Back sleepers often do well with medium-firm
- Larger people generally need firmer surfaces
- Mattresses wear out—consider replacing every 7-10 years

## Getting In and Out of Bed

How you transition matters too:

**Getting into bed:**
1. Sit on edge of bed
2. Lower down onto your side
3. Bring legs up together
4. Roll to desired position

**Getting out of bed:**
1. Roll onto your side
2. Push up with your arms
3. Swing legs off the bed
4. Stand slowly

**Why this matters:** Sitting straight up from lying down (like a sit-up) strains back and core—especially problematic postpartum or with back issues.

---

## Changing Your Sleep Position

If you want to transition to a different position:

**Be patient:** It takes 2-4 weeks to change sleep habits

**Use props:**
- Body pillow behind back to prevent rolling to stomach
- Tennis ball in pocket of shirt prevents back sleeping
- Pregnancy pillow creates natural boundaries

**Start at sleep onset:** You'll likely move during the night, but starting in optimal position helps

**Celebrate progress:** Any reduction in time in problematic position helps

---

## Morning Routines for Sleep-Related Stiffness

If you wake stiff regardless of position:

**Before getting up:**
1. Gentle knee-to-chest stretch (one at a time)
2. Spinal twist (knees to one side, then other)
3. Cat-cow stretches on hands and knees after rising

**First minutes:**
- Move gently—don't jump into activity
- Hot shower can help loosen stiff muscles
- Light stretching before exercise
