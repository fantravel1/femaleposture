# Sleep Posture Guide

> **You Spend a Third of Life Sleeping:** Those 6-8 hours matter for your spine. The right sleep position supports healing and prevents pain; the wrong one creates problems.

---

## Why Sleep Position Matters

### What Happens During Sleep

- Spine decompresses
- Tissues repair
- Muscles relax (or tense)
- Position sustained for hours
- No conscious adjustment

### When Position Goes Wrong

- Wake with pain or stiffness
- Existing problems worsen
- New issues develop
- Sleep quality suffers

---

## Back Sleeping

### The Pros

- Spine in neutral alignment
- Weight evenly distributed
- Face not pressed (skin benefits)
- Generally good for spine

### The Cons

- Worsens sleep apnea
- Can increase snoring
- Lower back may arch excessively
- Not for everyone

### Optimizing Back Sleep

**Pillow:**
- Support head, not elevate
- Neck curve supported
- Not too high or flat

**Under knees:**
- Small pillow or rolled towel
- Reduces lower back arch
- Very helpful for back pain

**Mattress:**
- Medium-firm often best
- Should support curves
- Not too soft or hard

---

## Side Sleeping

### The Pros

- Most common position
- Good for many people
- Reduces snoring/apnea
- Comfortable for pregnancy

### The Cons

- Shoulder compression
- Hip pressure
- Can curve spine if unsupported

### Optimizing Side Sleep

**Pillow:**
- Fill gap between shoulder and head
- Keep neck aligned with spine
- Thicker pillow than back sleeping

**Between knees:**
- Essential for spine alignment
- Full-length pillow or regular pillow
- Prevents hip rotation

**Shoulder position:**
- Not lying directly on shoulder point
- Slightly forward or arm in front
- Avoid compressed, pinched feeling

### Left vs. Right Side

**Left side may help:**
- Digestion (anatomy)
- Heartburn/reflux
- Pregnancy (circulation)

**Right side:**
- Fine for most people
- May prefer one side
- Switch when possible

---

## Stomach Sleeping

### The Problem

**Significant spine stress:**
- Neck rotated fully to breathe
- Lower back arches excessively
- Strain on multiple joints
- Generally not recommended

### If You Can't Stop

**Minimize damage:**
- Very flat pillow (or none)
- Pillow under pelvis
- Try turning to side during night
- Work on transitioning

### Transitioning Away

- Takes time (weeks to months)
- Use pillows to prevent rolling
- Body pillow to hug
- Be patient

---

## The Pillow

### Head Pillow

**Purpose:**
- Support neck curve
- Keep head aligned with spine
- Not prop head up or let it drop

**For back sleepers:**
- Medium-low height
- Contoured or moldable
- Not too thick

**For side sleepers:**
- Higher to fill shoulder gap
- May need firmer support
- Gusseted pillows helpful

### Knee Pillow

**For back sleepers:**
- Under knees
- Reduces lower back arch

**For side sleepers:**
- Between knees
- Essential for alignment
- Full-length body pillow works

### Additional Pillows

- Under arm (side sleep)
- Small of back (back sleep, if needed)
- Support where needed

---

## The Mattress

### Firmness

**Too soft:**
- Body sinks
- Spine curves
- Hard to turn
- Poor support

**Too firm:**
- Pressure points
- Doesn't contour
- Uncomfortable
- May cause problems

**Right for you:**
- Spine aligned
- No pressure pain
- Comfortable
- Varies by person

### General Guidance

- Medium-firm suits most
- Heavier bodies may need firmer
- Lighter bodies may need softer
- Side sleepers often like softer
- Back sleepers often like firmer

### Mattress Age

- Replace every 7-10 years
- Sooner if sagging
- Body changes—needs change
- Important investment
