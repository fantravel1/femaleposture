# Sleeping Posture

You spend a third of your life sleeping—how you position your body during those hours significantly affects your waking posture and pain levels. Understanding proper sleeping posture improves both sleep quality and daytime comfort.

## Sleep Position Basics

### Side Sleeping

**Most common position:**
- Knees slightly bent
- Pillow between knees
- Spine aligned
- Pillow height matching shoulder
- Arms comfortable

### Back Sleeping

**Neutral position:**
- Pillow supporting head
- Small pillow under knees
- Neutral spine
- Arms at sides or on chest
- Relaxed position

### Stomach Sleeping

**Challenging position:**
- Generally not recommended
- Neck rotation strain
- Low back compression
- If necessary, flat pillow
- Pillow under pelvis option

## Pillow Selection

### For Side Sleepers

**Proper support:**
- Higher loft
- Fills shoulder gap
- Neutral neck
- Firm enough support
- Quality materials

### For Back Sleepers

**Lower profile:**
- Medium loft
- Supports natural curve
- Not pushing head forward
- Comfortable width
- Appropriate firmness

## Mattress Considerations

### Firmness Selection

**Finding right level:**
- Body weight factor
- Sleep position factor
- Pain considerations
- Personal preference
- Trial period use

### Women-Specific Needs

**Female considerations:**
- Hip support for side sleepers
- Shoulder accommodation
- Temperature regulation
- Weight distribution
- Changing needs over time

## Waking Up

### Morning Transition

**Safe rising:**
- Roll to side first
- Use arms to push up
- Swing legs over
- Sit before standing
- Stretch gently

## Common Sleep Issues

### Pain on Waking

**Addressing problems:**
- Position evaluation
- Pillow adjustment
- Mattress assessment
- Sleep environment
- Professional consultation if persistent

Good sleeping posture supports restorative rest and prevents the back and neck pain that can result from poor nighttime positioning.
