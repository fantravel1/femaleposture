# Reaching Posture

Reaching high and low is a daily necessity, but improper reaching strains shoulders, back, and neck. Proper reaching technique protects your body while accessing what you need.

## Overhead Reaching

### Proper Technique

**High reaching:**
- Step stool for height
- Face target directly
- Don't overextend
- Keep core engaged
- Arms at safe angles

### Common Mistakes

**What to avoid:**
- Reaching too far
- Standing on tiptoe unsafely
- Twisting while reaching
- Heavy loads overhead
- Prolonged arm elevation

## Low Reaching

### Proper Technique

**Ground level:**
- Squat or kneel
- One knee down option
- Hip hinge for shallow reach
- Keep spine neutral
- Use support if available

### Sustained Low Work

**Extended reaching:**
- Knee pads
- Position changes
- Regular breaks
- Long-handled tools
- Raise work level when possible

## Side Reaching

### Proper Technique

**Lateral access:**
- Turn body toward target
- Step closer
- Don't twist from spine
- Move feet
- Face work

## Shelf and Cabinet Reaching

### High Shelves

**Upper storage:**
- Step stool use
- Light items high
- Reorganize frequently used
- Don't overload
- Safe climbing

### Low Shelves

**Lower storage:**
- Squat to access
- Organize by frequency
- Pull-out shelves if possible
- Proper squatting
- Avoid prolonged bending

## Reducing Reaching Needs

### Organization

**Ergonomic setup:**
- Frequently used items at reach

Good reaching posture protects shoulders and back while allowing safe access to items at all heights.
