# Cleaning Posture Guide

> **Housework Is Work:** Cleaning involves bending, lifting, reaching, and repetitive motions—often for hours. Good technique protects your body.

---

## General Cleaning Principles

### Body Mechanics

1. **Bend at hips and knees, not back**
2. **Keep loads close**
3. **Face your work** - don't twist
4. **Use your legs**
5. **Switch sides and positions**

### Pacing

- Break into sessions
- Rest between tasks
- Don't marathon clean
- Spread heavy work across days

---

## Vacuuming

### Common Problems

- Forward bending
- Repetitive pushing
- One-sided motion
- Reaching under furniture

### Better Technique

**Position:**
- Stand upright (don't hunch)
- Lunge stance (one foot forward)
- Keep vacuum close to body

**Movement:**
- Move with your feet
- Don't just reach arms
- Use whole body, not just arms
- Switch leading leg/hand

**Tips:**
- Lightweight vacuum if possible
- Extend handle to reduce bending
- Move furniture rather than strain to reach
- Take breaks every 15-20 minutes

## Mopping

### Common Problems

### Better Technique

**Position:**
- Mop handle at proper height

### Better Technique

**Kneeling:**
