    <h2>How to Use These Tools</h2>
    <div class="content-block">
      <h3>1. Start with the Complete Assessment</h3>
      <p>Take 10-15 minutes to do the full <a href="/tools/posture-self-assessment/">posture self-assessment</a>. This gives you a baseline and helps identify priority areas.</p>

      <h3>2. Use the Wall Test for Tracking</h3>
      <p>Once a week or every few weeks, do the quick <a href="/tools/wall-test/">wall test</a> to monitor your progress. It only takes 30 seconds.</p>

      <h3>3. Reassess After 4-6 Weeks</h3>
      <p>After consistent work on your posture, redo the complete assessment. Compare your results to see improvement.</p>

      <h3>Important Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>These are screening tools, not diagnoses</li>
        <li>Seek professional evaluation for pain or concerning findings</li>
        <li>Progress takes time—be patient with yourself</li>
        <li>Consistency matters more than perfection</li>
      </ul>
