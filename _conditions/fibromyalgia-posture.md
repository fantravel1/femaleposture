# Fibromyalgia and Posture

Fibromyalgia (FM) causes widespread pain, fatigue, and tenderness. Posture is both affected by and affects fibromyalgia—poor posture can worsen pain, while the condition can make maintaining good posture challenging.

## The Fibromyalgia-Posture Connection

### How FM Affects Posture

**Contributing factors:**
- Pain causes guarding
- Fatigue makes holding posture hard
- Tender points in postural muscles
- Sleep issues affect muscle recovery
- Deconditioning develops

### How Posture Affects FM

- Pain levels
- Fatigue
- Overall symptoms

## Common Postural Patterns

### What Often Develops

**Typical patterns:**

- Rounded shoulders
- Protective curling
- Muscle guarding
- Reduced movement

### Why These Patterns Develop

**Pain response:**
- Body protects painful areas
- Movement avoidance
- Deconditioning cycle
- Fear of pain with movement
