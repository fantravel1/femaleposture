- Common in women

**Internal:**
- Hip flexor over pelvis
- Front of hip clicks
- Often with flexion

## Posture Effects

### Movement Changes

- May alter gait
- Avoid certain movements
- Compensation patterns
- Can become painful

### Contributing Factors

- Muscle imbalances
- Tightness patterns
- Hip weakness
- Posture habits

## Management

### Stretching Focus

**Key areas:**
- IT band
- Hip flexors
- Tensor fascia latae
