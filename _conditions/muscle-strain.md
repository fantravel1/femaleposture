# Muscle Strain

Muscle strains are tears in muscle fibers that can occur from acute injury or chronic overload. Poor posture contributes to muscle strain by placing certain muscles under constant stress.

## How Posture Causes Strain

### Chronic Overload

**What happens:**
- Muscles held in lengthened positions
- Constant low-level tension
- Fatigue accumulates
- Eventually strain occurs

### Common Sites

**Posture-related strains:**
- Upper back (rhomboids, traps)
- Neck muscles
- Lower back muscles
- Shoulder blade muscles

## Treatment

### Acute Phase

**Initial management:**
- Relative rest
- Ice (first 48-72 hours)
- Gentle movement
- Avoid aggravating activities

### Recovery Phase

**As healing progresses:**
- Gentle stretching
- Gradual strengthening
- Return to activities
- Posture correction

## Prevention

### Address Posture

**Key strategies:**
- Correct underlying posture issues
- Strengthen supporting muscles
- Regular movement breaks
- Ergonomic setup

## Key Points

1. **Posture contributes** — Chronic overload
2. **Common in postural muscles** — Back, neck, shoulders
3. **Rest and gradual return** — Allow healing
4. **Prevent recurrence** — Fix the posture issue
