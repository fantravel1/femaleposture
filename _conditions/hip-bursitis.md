# Hip Bursitis (Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome)

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), often called hip bursitis, causes pain on the outside of the hip. While "bursitis" suggests an inflamed bursa, most cases actually involve tendon issues. This condition is significantly more common in women.

## Understanding GTPS

### Anatomy

**The area involved:**
- Greater trochanter (hip bone prominence)
- Gluteal tendons attach here
- Bursae provide cushioning
- IT band crosses over area
- Multiple structures can be affected

### What's Actually Happening

**Modern understanding:**
- Often tendinopathy, not bursitis
- Gluteal tendon degeneration
- Bursa may be secondarily inflamed
- Compression is a factor
- "GTPS" is more accurate term

### Why Women Are More Affected

**2-4 times more common in women:**
- Wider pelvis creates different angle
- Hormonal effects on tendons
- Q-angle differences
- Postmenopausal changes
- Different movement patterns

## Causes

### Biomechanical Factors

**Contributing issues:**
- Hip drop during walking/running
- Weak hip abductors
- IT band tightness
- Leg length difference
- Foot overpronation

### Postural Factors

**Position-related:**
- Standing on one hip
- Sleeping on affected side
- Sitting cross-legged
- Prolonged standing
- Trendelenburg gait

### Activity Factors

**From overuse:**
- Running (especially hills)
- Walking long distances
- Stair climbing
- Sudden increase in activity
- Repetitive movements

### Age and Hormones

**Risk increases with:**
- Menopause
- Tendon degeneration
- Less active lifestyle
- Previous injury

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Typical presentation:**
- Pain over outer hip bone
- Pain lying on affected side
- Pain with stairs
- Pain with prolonged walking
- Tenderness over greater trochanter

### Pattern Recognition

**Characteristic features:**
- Worse at night (lying on side)
- Aggravated by sitting cross-legged
- Pain with single leg activities
- May have clicking sensation
- Can radiate down outer thigh

### Severity

**Ranges from:**
- Mild: Only with certain activities
- Moderate: Affects daily activities
- Severe: Constant, disturbs sleep

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Check for:**
- Point tenderness over hip bone
- Pain lying on that side
- Pain worse with standing on one leg
- Pain with climbing stairs
- Relief with rest

### Clinical Examination

**Tests may include:**
- Palpation of greater trochanter
- Single leg stance test
- Hip strength testing
- Gait analysis
- Rule out other conditions

### When Imaging Is Needed

**May help if:**
- Not responding to treatment
- Need to rule out other issues
- Considering injection
- Surgery being considered

## Treatment

### What to Avoid (Critical)

**Positions that compress:**
- Sleeping on affected side
- Sitting cross-legged
- Standing on one hip
- IT band stretches that compress
- Deep hip stretches that adduct

### Position Modifications

**For sleeping:**
- Sleep on unaffected side
- Pillow between knees
- If on back, pillow under knees
- Avoid letting legs cross midline

**For sitting:**
- Don't cross legs
- Keep knees apart
- Use cushion if needed
- Avoid low soft chairs

### Gluteal Strengthening

**Side-lying abduction:**
1. Lie on unaffected side
2. Top leg straight
3. Lift slightly (not too high)
4. Keep pelvis stable
5. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Clamshells:**
1. Side-lying, knees bent
2. Keep feet together
3. Lift top knee
4. Don't rotate pelvis
5. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Standing hip abduction:**
1. Stand holding wall
2. Lift leg out to side
3. Keep pelvis level
4. Slow and controlled
5. 15 reps each side

**Single leg stance:**
1. Stand on affected leg
2. Keep pelvis level
3. Progress duration
4. Progress to unstable surface

### What NOT to Do

**Avoid:**
- IT band foam rolling on tender spot
- Stretches that cross leg over midline
- Deep piriformis stretching initially
- High-impact activities during flare

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Daily Habits

**Changes to make:**
- Don't stand on one hip
- Keep weight even on both feet
- Use handrail on stairs
- Modify activities during flare
- Regular position changes

### Exercise Modifications

**Helpful:**
- Swimming
- Cycling (may need bike fit)
- Walking (shorter duration)
- Low-impact activities

**May need modification:**
- Running
- Stair climbing
- Prolonged walking
- Single-leg exercises

### Sleeping

**Position changes:**
- Pillow between knees always
- Don't let legs cross midline
- Firm mattress may help
- Consider mattress topper

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Load management education
- Progressive strengthening
- Gait retraining
- Manual therapy
- Activity modification

### Injections

**When considered:**
- Failed conservative treatment
- Severe pain
- Can help with diagnosis
- May allow exercise progression

### Other Options

**May help:**
- Shockwave therapy
- PRP injections
- Very rarely surgery

## Prognosis

### Expectations

**With proper treatment:**
- Most improve in 3-6 months
- Strengthening is key
- Avoiding compression important
- May need ongoing maintenance
- Recurrence possible without preventive exercise

## Key Points

1. **Not just bursitis** — Often tendon issue
2. **Very common in women** — Anatomical factors
3. **Avoid compression** — Key to recovery
4. **Strengthen glutes** — Progressive loading
5. **Sleeping position matters** — Pillow between knees
6. **Don't stretch deeply** — Can worsen initially
