# Hip Bursitis

Trochanteric bursitis causes lateral hip pain that often affects gait, sleeping positions, and overall posture patterns.

## Understanding Hip Bursitis

### What Happens

- Bursa becomes inflamed
- Friction from IT band
- Pain with lying on side
- Tender over hip bone

### Posture Effects

- Limping patterns develop
- Avoid hip abduction
- Lean away from painful side
- Sleep position problems

## Treatment

### Initial Management

**Reduce inflammation:**
- Ice application
- Activity modification
- Avoid lying on that side

### Corrective Work

**Address causes:**
- IT band stretching
- Hip strengthening
- Glute activation
- Core stability

## Key Points

1. **Common in women** — Hip structure factors
2. **IT band related** — Friction causes inflammation
3. **Strengthening helps** — Glutes support hip
4. **Posture matters** — Correct imbalances
