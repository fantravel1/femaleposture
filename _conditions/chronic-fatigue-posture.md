# Chronic Fatigue and Posture

Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) causes profound exhaustion that's not improved by rest. Maintaining good posture requires energy—a precious resource for those with CFS. Smart strategies help conserve energy while supporting the body.

## The Challenge

### How Fatigue Affects Posture

**Contributing factors:**
- Muscle weakness from deconditioning
- Energy cost of holding posture
- Brain fog affecting awareness
- Post-exertional malaise
- Need for energy conservation

### How Poor Posture Affects Fatigue

**Vicious cycle:**
- Slouching requires more effort long-term
- Poor breathing reduces oxygen
- Muscle fatigue increases
- Pain adds to burden
- More energy depleted

## Energy-Conserving Posture

### Principles

**Smart approach:**
- Use support strategically
- Reduce holding effort
- Change positions frequently
- Rest before exhausted
- Efficient alignment

### Supported Positions

**When sitting:**
- Use chair back fully
- Armrests for arms
- Feet supported
- Lumbar support
- Head supported if possible

**When lying:**
- Pillows under knees
- Proper pillow for head
- Side-lying with support
- Minimize position changes

## Gentle Movement

### Very Gradual Approach

**Critical for CFS:**
- Incredibly gentle start
- Watch for PEM (post-exertional malaise)
- Less is more initially
- Consistency over intensity

### Starting Point

**May begin with:**
- Breathing exercises only
- Gentle arm movements lying down
- Ankle circles
- Minimal energy cost

### Progression

**If tolerated:**
- Very gradual increase
- Pullback if PEM occurs
- Individual pace
- No forcing

## Daily Strategies

### Activity Pacing

**Energy management:**
- Break activities into parts
- Rest between activities
- Plan rest periods
- Stop before exhaustion

### Environment Setup

**Reduce effort:**
- Accessible items
- Supportive seating throughout
- Bed at good height
- Minimize bending needs

## Key Points

1. **Energy is limited** — Use wisely
2. **Support reduces effort** — Use chairs, pillows
3. **Very gentle movement** — Watch for PEM
4. **Pacing is essential** — Rest before exhausted
5. **Individual approach** — What works varies
6. **Professional support** — Specialized guidance helps
