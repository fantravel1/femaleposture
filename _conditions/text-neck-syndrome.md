# Text Neck Syndrome

Text neck syndrome is a modern repetitive strain injury caused by looking down at phones, tablets, and other devices for extended periods. The forward head position dramatically increases strain on the cervical spine, leading to pain, stiffness, and postural changes.

## Understanding Text Neck

### The Mechanics

**Head weight multiplication:**
- Neutral position: Head weighs ~10-12 lbs
- 15° tilt: Effective weight ~27 lbs
- 30° tilt: Effective weight ~40 lbs
- 45° tilt: Effective weight ~49 lbs
- 60° tilt: Effective weight ~60 lbs

**Why it matters:**
- Average phone use: 2-4 hours daily
- Many check phones 80+ times per day
- Cumulative strain adds up
- Structural changes can occur

### Symptoms

**Early signs:**
- Neck pain and stiffness
- Upper back discomfort
- Shoulder tension
- Headaches (especially at skull base)
- Reduced neck mobility

**Advanced symptoms:**
- Chronic pain
- Nerve irritation (tingling in arms)
- Muscle spasms
- Reduced cervical curve
- Premature disc degeneration

## Causes in Women

### Device Usage Patterns

**Higher risk factors:**
- Social media use
- Texting frequency
- Reading on devices
- Working from phone
- Entertainment consumption

### Physical Factors

**Women-specific considerations:**
- Generally smaller neck muscles
- May carry tension differently
- Multitasking while on phone
- Phone holding while with children

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Wall test:**
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Heels touching wall
3. Can you easily touch head to wall?
4. Difficulty suggests forward head posture

**Photo assessment:**
- Side profile photo
- Is ear forward of shoulder?
- Check degree of forward head

### When to See a Doctor

**Seek evaluation if:**
- Pain persists despite changes
- Numbness or tingling in arms
- Weakness in hands
- Severe headaches
- Symptoms worsen despite rest

## Prevention Strategies

### Device Ergonomics

**Phone positioning:**
- Raise phone to eye level
- Use phone stands when possible
- Avoid phone in lap position
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes

**Other devices:**
- Tablet in stand, not lap
- Laptop with external monitor
- Desktop screen at eye level

### Usage Habits

**Reduce strain:**
- Use voice-to-text
- Voice calls instead of texting
- Limit social media scrolling
- Set screen time limits
- Use larger screens when available

## Exercises for Text Neck

### Chin Tucks

**How to perform:**
1. Sit or stand with good posture
2. Gently pull chin straight back
3. Create a "double chin"
4. Hold 5 seconds
5. Repeat 10-15 times

**When to do:** Every hour during phone use

### Neck Stretches

**Lateral neck stretch:**
1. Tilt ear toward shoulder
2. Gentle hand pressure on head
3. Hold 30 seconds
4. Repeat other side

**Levator scapulae stretch:**
1. Look down toward armpit
2. Gentle pressure with hand
3. Hold 30 seconds each side

### Upper Back Strengthening

**Shoulder blade squeezes:**
1. Squeeze shoulder blades together
2. Hold 5 seconds
3. 15 repetitions, 3 sets

**Prone Y-T-W:**
1. Lie face down
2. Lift arms in Y position
3. Then T position
4. Then W position
5. 10 each, 2 sets

### Chest Stretches

**Doorway stretch:**
1. Arms on door frame at 90°
2. Step through with one foot
3. Feel stretch across chest
4. Hold 30 seconds, repeat 3 times

## Daily Management

### Morning Routine (5 min)

1. Chin tucks: 15 reps
2. Neck circles: 10 each direction
3. Shoulder rolls: 10 each direction

### During the Day

- Set hourly phone reminders
- Raise phone when using
- Take tech breaks
- Walk without phone occasionally

### Evening Routine (10 min)

1. All neck stretches
2. Chest doorway stretch
3. Foam roller upper back
4. Shoulder blade exercises

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Postural assessment
- Manual therapy
- Exercise prescription
- Ergonomic education
- Dry needling for trigger points

### Other Interventions

**When needed:**
- Massage therapy
- Chiropractic care
- Acupuncture
- Anti-inflammatory medication
- Muscle relaxants (short-term)

## Prevention for Different Ages

### Teenagers

- Education about risks
- Phone-free times
- Encourage sports/activities
- Model good habits
- Device time limits

### Young Adults

- Workspace ergonomics
- Exercise routine establishment
- Awareness building
- Habit formation

### Older Adults

- May have less adaptation capacity
- Importance of prevention
- Gentle exercise approach
- Regular movement breaks

## Key Points

1. **The angle matters** — Even 15° forward increases neck strain significantly
2. **Cumulative damage** — Hours of daily use add up over years
3. **Prevention is key** — Raise your phone, take breaks
4. **Exercises help** — Chin tucks and strengthening reverse damage
5. **Structural changes possible** — Don't ignore chronic symptoms
6. **It's reversible** — With consistent effort, most cases improve
