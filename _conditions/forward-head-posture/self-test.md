# Forward Head Posture Self-Test: 5-Minute Assessment

> **Quick Summary:** These three simple tests will tell you if you have forward head posture and how severe it is. No equipment needed beyond a wall and a mirror. Takes just 5 minutes.

---

## Why Test Yourself?

Forward head posture (FHP) develops gradually. Most people don't realize they have it until symptoms appear—neck pain, headaches, shoulder tension. By then, the pattern is well-established.

Early detection means easier correction. These tests give you a baseline to measure your progress as you work on improving your posture.

## Test 1: The Wall Test

**Time:** 2 minutes
**What you need:** A flat wall

### Instructions

1. Remove your shoes and stand with your back against a wall
2. Position your heels about 2 inches from the wall
3. Let your buttocks and shoulder blades touch the wall naturally
4. **Important:** Don't force anything—stand as you normally would
5. Relax completely and breathe normally

### What to Check

**Does your head naturally touch the wall?**

- **Head touches wall comfortably:** Normal alignment
- **Head touches with effort:** Mild FHP—you can correct but it requires muscle activation
- **1-finger gap (about 1 inch):** Mild to moderate FHP
- **2-finger gap (about 2 inches):** Moderate FHP—consistent exercise needed
- **3+ finger gap:** Significant FHP—consider professional assessment

### What This Means

In ideal posture, your ear, shoulder, hip, and ankle should align vertically when viewed from the side. If your head doesn't touch the wall naturally, your head sits forward of this ideal line.

## Test 2: The Mirror Test (Ear-Over-Shoulder)

**Time:** 2 minutes
**What you need:** A mirror you can view from the side, or a friend/camera

### Instructions

1. Stand naturally—don't try to "fix" your posture
2. Turn sideways to a mirror, or have someone take a photo of your profile
3. Look for the position of your ear relative to your shoulder

### What to Check

Imagine a vertical line dropping from your ear canal:

- **Line passes through center of shoulder:** Good alignment
- **Line falls in front of shoulder:** Forward head posture present
- **Line falls 1-2 inches in front:** Moderate FHP
- **Line falls 3+ inches in front:** Significant FHP

### Visual Markers

From the side, also notice:
- Does your chin jut forward?
- Is there a pronounced curve at the base of your neck?
- Do your shoulders round forward along with your head?

## Test 3: The Chin Tuck Test

**Time:** 1 minute
**What you need:** Nothing

### Instructions

1. Sit or stand with normal posture
2. Look straight ahead (don't look up or down)
3. Draw your chin straight back, as if making a "double chin"
4. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then relax
5. Repeat 3-5 times

### What to Check

**How far can you retract your chin?**

- **Very little movement (less than 1/2 inch):** Significant muscle shortening; your forward head position has become your "normal"
- **Moderate movement (1/2 to 1 inch):** Mild to moderate FHP
- **Significant movement (1-2 inches):** Your starting position is quite forward, but you have good range of motion for correction

**How does it feel?**

- Mild stretch at the back of your neck: Normal
- Significant tightness or discomfort: Muscle shortening present
- Pain: Stop and consult a professional

## Understanding Your Results

### Scoring Your Forward Head Posture

| Severity | Wall Test | Mirror Test | Action Needed |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **None** | Head touches wall | Ear over shoulder | Maintenance exercises |
| **Mild** | 1-finger gap | Ear slightly forward | Daily exercises, 4-6 weeks |
| **Moderate** | 2-finger gap | Ear 1-2" forward | Consistent exercises, 8-12 weeks |
| **Significant** | 3+ finger gap | Ear 3"+ forward | Professional assessment + exercises |

### Factors That Affect Results

Your results may vary based on:

- **Time of day:** We're usually more forward-headed by evening
- **Fatigue level:** Tired muscles can't support good posture
- **Recent activity:** Desk work or phone use right before testing
- **Life stage:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or carrying young children

For the most accurate baseline, test yourself:
- First thing in the morning
- Before phone or computer use
- When you're reasonably rested

## What To Do With Your Results

### If You Have Mild FHP

Start with:
- [Chin tucks](/exercises/chin-tucks/): 10-15 reps, 3-5 times daily
- Hourly posture check-ins
- Phone and desk ergonomic adjustments

### If You Have Moderate FHP

Your daily routine should include:
- Morning: Chin tucks + neck stretches (5 minutes)
- Throughout day: Hourly chin tucks (30 seconds each)
- Evening: Full correction routine including upper back exercises (10 minutes)

See our [Forward Head Posture Complete Guide](/conditions/forward-head-posture/complete-guide/) for the full program.

### If You Have Significant FHP

Consider:
- Professional assessment with a physical therapist
- Ruling out underlying conditions
- Structured correction program with professional guidance
- Ergonomic evaluation of your workspace

---

## Tracking Your Progress

Retest yourself every 2 weeks using the same tests. Take photos for comparison.

Expected timeline:
- **Week 2:** Increased awareness, may feel "worse" as you notice the problem
- **Week 4:** Easier to hold corrected position
- **Week 8:** Noticeable improvement in resting posture
- **Week 12:** Significant correction in most mild-moderate cases

---

## When These Tests Aren't Enough

See a professional if:

- You have pain that radiates down your arm
- You experience numbness or tingling in your hands
- You have difficulty turning your head
- Symptoms don't improve after 6 weeks of consistent exercises
- You're pregnant and experiencing new neck pain
- You've had a neck injury
