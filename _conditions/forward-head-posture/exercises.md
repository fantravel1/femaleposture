# 8 Best Exercises to Fix Forward Head Posture

> **Quick Summary:** These eight exercises target the specific muscle imbalances causing forward head posture. Done consistently for 10-15 minutes daily, most people see significant improvement in 8-12 weeks.

---

## Understanding the Muscle Imbalances

Forward head posture involves predictable patterns:

**Tight/Overactive Muscles:**
- Suboccipitals (back of skull)
- Upper trapezius
- Levator scapulae
- Sternocleidomastoid (front of neck)
- Pectorals (chest)

**Weak/Inhibited Muscles:**
- Deep neck flexors (front of neck, deep)
- Lower trapezius
- Rhomboids
- Serratus anterior

The exercises below address both sides of this equation—releasing what's tight and strengthening what's weak.

## Exercise 1: Chin Tucks (Cervical Retraction)

**The #1 exercise for forward head posture**

### Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Deep neck flexors (longus colli, longus capitis) |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | None |
| **Time** | 2 minutes |

### Instructions

1. Sit or stand tall with shoulders relaxed
2. Look straight ahead—don't look up or down
3. Draw your chin straight back, as if making a "double chin"
4. Imagine a string pulling the back of your head up and back
5. Keep your eyes level—don't tilt your head
6. Hold for 5-10 seconds
7. Relax and repeat

**Sets/Reps:** 10-15 repetitions, 3-5 times throughout the day

### Common Mistakes

- Tilting head down instead of straight back
- Tensing shoulders up toward ears
- Holding breath
- Moving whole body instead of isolating neck

### Modifications

- **Easier:** Perform lying down with small towel roll under neck
- **Harder:** Add gentle overpressure with fingertips on chin
- **At wall:** Stand with back to wall, gently press back of head toward wall

## Exercise 2: Suboccipital Release

**Releases tension at the skull base**

### Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Suboccipital muscles |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | Two tennis balls in a sock, or peanut massage ball |
| **Time** | 3-5 minutes |

### Instructions

1. Lie on your back with knees bent
2. Place tennis balls at the base of your skull (where skull meets neck)
3. Allow the weight of your head to rest on the balls
4. Breathe deeply and relax for 1-2 minutes
5. Gently nod "yes" 10 times (small movement)
6. Gently shake "no" 10 times (small movement)
7. Rest for another minute

**Sets/Reps:** Once daily, especially after prolonged screen time

### Common Mistakes

- Placing balls on bony part of skull
- Pushing or forcing pressure
- Holding breath

### Modifications

- **Gentler:** Use a rolled-up towel instead of balls
- **Pregnancy:** Safe in all trimesters; use pillows to support if needed

## Exercise 3: Upper Trapezius Stretch

**Releases chronically tight upper traps**

### Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|

### Instructions

1. Sit or stand tall
2. Tilt your right ear toward your right shoulder
3. Place your right hand gently on your left temple (don't pull)

6. Hold 30 seconds
7. Repeat on other side

**Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions per side, twice daily

### Common Mistakes

- Pulling aggressively with hand
- Hiking the opposite shoulder up
- Turning head instead of tilting

## Exercise 4: Levator Scapulae Stretch

**Targets the muscle that elevates your shoulder blade**

### Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Levator scapulae |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | None |
| **Time** | 2 minutes |

### Instructions

1. Turn your head 45 degrees to the right
2. Look down toward your right armpit
3. Place your right hand on the back of your head
4. Gently add pressure, pulling your head forward and down

## Exercise 5: Doorway Chest Stretch

**Opens tight pectorals that pull shoulders forward**

### Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Pectoralis major and minor |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | Doorway |
| **Time** | 2 minutes |

### Instructions

1. Stand in a doorway
2. Place forearms on door frame, elbows at shoulder height

5. Keep core engaged—don't arch lower back
6. Hold 30 seconds

**Sets/Reps:** 3 repetitions, twice daily

### Modifications

- **Different angle:** Move elbows higher or lower to target different portions of the muscle
- **Pregnancy (2nd/3rd trimester):** Use a corner of a room instead; smaller range of motion
