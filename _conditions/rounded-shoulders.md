# Rounded Shoulders

> **Overview:** Rounded shoulders describe a postural pattern where the shoulders roll forward and inward, often accompanied by a rounded upper back. This common condition results from muscle imbalances and can be corrected with targeted exercises.

## What Are Rounded Shoulders?

In proper alignment, your shoulders should sit directly above your hips when viewed from the side, with a small, natural curve in your upper back. With rounded shoulders:

- Shoulders roll forward and inward
- Upper back becomes excessively rounded
- Chest muscles shorten
- Upper back muscles lengthen and weaken
- Often accompanies forward head posture

---

## Common Causes

- **Desk work:** Hours with arms forward on keyboard
- **Phone and tablet use:** Looking down, arms forward
- **Driving:** Arms forward on steering wheel
- **Weak upper back:** Muscles can't maintain position
- **Tight chest muscles:** Pull shoulders forward
- **Heavy breasts:** Weight pulls shoulders forward
- **Poor sleeping position:** Curled up on side
- **Low confidence posture:** Shoulders round protectively

---

## Symptoms

- Upper back pain or aching
- Shoulder pain or tightness
- Neck pain and headaches
- Reduced arm mobility
- Difficulty taking deep breaths
- Visible hump at upper back
- Clothes fitting poorly across chest/back

---

## Self-Assessment

**The Wall Test:**
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Heels, buttocks, and upper back touching
3. Try to touch your shoulder blades to the wall

**What to look for:**
- Can shoulder blades touch wall without forcing?
- Do shoulders naturally stay against wall?
- Is there a large gap between your shoulders and the wall?

If you can't comfortably get your shoulders against the wall, you likely have rounded shoulders.

## The Muscle Imbalance

Rounded shoulders result from:

**Tight and overactive:**
- Pectoralis major and minor (chest)
- Anterior deltoids (front of shoulders)
- Upper trapezius (upper back/neck)

**Weak and underactive:**
- Rhomboids (between shoulder blades)
- Lower trapezius (mid-back)
- Serratus anterior (side of ribs)
- Rotator cuff muscles

---

## Treatment Approach

Correcting rounded shoulders requires:

1. **Stretching tight muscles:** Chest, front of shoulders
2. **Strengthening weak muscles:** Upper back, rotator cuff
3. **Postural awareness:** Regular position checks
4. **Ergonomic changes:** Desk, phone, sleeping position

Most people see noticeable improvement within 4-8 weeks.
