# Core Weakness

A weak core fails to support the spine properly, contributing to poor posture, back pain, and movement dysfunction. Core strength is foundational to good posture.

## Understanding Core Weakness

### What Is Core

**More than abs:**
- Deep abdominals (transverse abdominis)
- Back muscles (multifidus)
- Pelvic floor
- Diaphragm
- Rectus and obliques

### Effects of Weakness

**Postural impact:**
- Can't maintain good posture
- Fatigue with upright position
- Lower back pain
- Poor movement control

## Common Causes

### Why It Develops

- Sedentary lifestyle
- Pregnancy/postpartum
- Injury or surgery
- Never trained properly
- Aging without exercise

## Treatment

### Core Training

**Progressive approach:**
- Dead bugs
- Bird dogs
- Planks (proper form)
- Anti-rotation exercises

### Integration

**Functional:**
- Maintain core during activities
- Apply to daily movements
- Endurance focus

## Key Points

1. **Foundation of posture** — Essential for alignment
2. **More than abs** — Full cylinder of muscles
3. **Can be trained** — Responds to exercise
4. **Endurance matters** — Not just strength
