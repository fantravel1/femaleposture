# 10 Best Exercises to Fix Rounded Shoulders

> **Quick Summary:** These 10 exercises target the specific muscle imbalances causing rounded shoulders. The key is stretching tight chest muscles while strengthening weak upper back muscles. Done consistently for 10-15 minutes daily, most people see significant improvement in 8-12 weeks.

---

## The Approach: Stretch AND Strengthen

Fixing rounded shoulders requires a two-pronged approach:

1. **Stretch** the tight muscles pulling shoulders forward (pectorals, front deltoids)
2. **Strengthen** the weak muscles that should pull shoulders back (rhomboids, lower traps, rear deltoids)

Doing only one without the other produces minimal results.

## Stretching Exercises (Do First)

### Exercise 1: Doorway Chest Stretch

**The most important stretch for rounded shoulders**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Pectoralis major |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | Doorway |
| **Time** | 2 minutes |

**Instructions:**

1. Stand in a doorway
2. Place forearms on door frame, elbows at shoulder height
3. Step one foot forward through the doorway
4. Lean forward until you feel a stretch across your chest
5. Keep core engaged—don't arch lower back
6. Hold for 30 seconds
7. Repeat 3 times

**Variations:**
- **Elbows lower:** Targets upper pec fibers
- **Elbows higher:** Targets lower pec fibers
- **One arm at a time:** For uneven tightness

**Pregnancy modification:** Use corner of room; reduce lean distance in third trimester.

### Exercise 2: Corner Pec Minor Stretch

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | Pectoralis minor |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Equipment** | Wall corner |
| **Time** | 2 minutes |

**Instructions:**

1. Stand facing a corner
2. Place forearms on each wall, elbows at shoulder height
3. Feet about 12 inches from corner
4. Lean your chest toward the corner
5. You should feel deep stretch in chest/front of shoulders
6. Hold 30 seconds, repeat 3 times

**Why it matters:** The pec minor is often the main culprit in rounded shoulders—it attaches to the shoulder blade and pulls it forward.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Only stretching, not strengthening** — Won't produce lasting change
2. **Only strengthening, not stretching** — Tight muscles limit range
3. **Doing exercises once and expecting results** — Consistency is key
4. **Using too much weight on back exercises** — Form over weight
5. **Forgetting posture the rest of the day** — Exercise alone isn't enough
