# Do You Have Rounded Shoulders? Self-Assessment

> **Quick Summary:** These four simple tests will tell you if you have rounded shoulders and how severe the condition is. No equipment needed. Takes just 5 minutes.

---

## Why Test Yourself?

Rounded shoulders develop so gradually that many women don't realize they have the condition until they see a photo of themselves from the side or start experiencing pain. Early detection means easier correction.

## Test 1: The Wall Test

**Time:** 1 minute

### Instructions

1. Stand with your back against a wall
2. Position heels about 2 inches from the wall
3. Let your buttocks touch the wall
4. Relax completely—don't try to "fix" your posture
5. Check whether your shoulder blades touch the wall

### Results

| What You Find | What It Means |
|---------------|---------------|
| Both shoulder blades rest comfortably on wall | Normal shoulder position |
| Shoulders touch with effort/feels like a stretch | Mild rounded shoulders |
| Shoulders don't reach wall at all | Moderate to significant rounded shoulders |

---

## Test 2: The Pencil Test

**Time:** 30 seconds

### Instructions

1. Hold a pencil (or pen) in each fist
2. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides
3. Look down at the direction the pencils point

### Results

| Pencil Direction | What It Means |
|------------------|---------------|
| Pencils point straight forward | Normal shoulder rotation |
| Pencils point toward each other | Internally rotated shoulders (mild) |
| Pencils point behind you | Significantly internally rotated (often accompanies rounded shoulders) |

---

## Test 3: Behind-Back Reach Test

**Time:** 1 minute

### Instructions

1. Reach your right arm overhead
2. Bend your elbow and reach your hand down your back
3. Reach your left arm behind your back and up
4. Try to touch or clasp your fingers together
5. Note the distance between your fingertips
6. Switch arms and repeat

### Results

| Distance | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| Fingers touch or clasp | Good shoulder mobility |
| Gap of 1-2 inches | Mild restriction |
| Gap of 2-4 inches | Moderate tightness (common with rounded shoulders) |
| Gap of 4+ inches | Significant tightness |

**Note:** It's normal to have some difference between sides, but significant asymmetry (more than 2 inches) may indicate uneven tightness.

## Test 4: Mirror Observation

**Time:** 2 minutes

### Instructions

Stand naturally in front of a mirror and observe:

**From the front:**
- Are your shoulders level, or is one higher?
- Do you see more of the front of your shoulders than the sides?
- Do your shoulders seem to fold inward?

**From the side (use a second mirror or photo):**
- Does the center of your shoulder sit forward of your ear?
- Is there a visible rounding of the upper back?
- Does your shoulder joint sit forward of your hip?

### What to Look For

**Normal alignment from side view:**
- Ear, shoulder, hip, and ankle roughly align vertically
- Shoulder blade sits flat against ribcage

**Rounded shoulders:**
- Shoulder visibly forward of ear
- Front of shoulder more visible than it should be
- Upper back appears rounded
- Shoulder blades may "wing" away from ribcage

## Scoring Your Results

### No Rounded Shoulders
- Wall test: Shoulders touch easily
- Pencil test: Pencils point forward
- Reach test: Fingers touch or nearly touch
- Mirror: Good alignment

**Recommendation:** Maintenance exercises to prevent future problems.

### Mild Rounded Shoulders
- Wall test: Shoulders touch with effort
- Pencil test: Pencils point slightly inward
- Reach test: 1-3 inch gap
- Mirror: Slight forward positioning

**Recommendation:** Daily stretching and strengthening routine, 10 minutes. Expect improvement in 4-6 weeks.

### Moderate Rounded Shoulders
- Wall test: Shoulders don't reach wall
- Pencil test: Pencils point toward each other or behind
- Reach test: 3-5 inch gap
- Mirror: Obvious forward positioning

**Recommendation:** Consistent daily routine of 15-20 minutes. Consider professional assessment. Expect improvement in 8-12 weeks.

### Significant Rounded Shoulders
- Wall test: Large gap between shoulders and wall
- Pencil test: Pencils point behind you
- Reach test: 5+ inch gap
- Mirror: Pronounced forward positioning and upper back rounding

**Recommendation:** Professional assessment recommended. Combine professional treatment with daily home exercises.

## Track Your Progress

Retest every 2-4 weeks using the same tests. Keep a record:

| Date | Wall Test | Pencil Test | Reach Test (R) | Reach Test (L) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

Taking photos from the side can also help you see progress over time.
