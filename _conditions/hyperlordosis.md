# Hyperlordosis

Hyperlordosis is an excessive inward curve of the lumbar spine, commonly called swayback. The pelvis tilts forward, the belly protrudes, and the buttocks stick out. This condition is common in women and often associated with lower back pain.

## Understanding Hyperlordosis

### Normal vs Excessive

**Normal lordosis:**
- 40-60 degrees of curve
- Natural and healthy
- Absorbs shock
- Allows spinal movement

**Hyperlordosis:**
- Greater than 60 degrees
- Excessive anterior pelvic tilt
- Visible postural changes
- Often symptomatic

### Appearance

**Characteristic look:**
- Pelvis tilted forward
- Belly protrudes (even if slim)
- Buttocks stick out
- Excessive low back arch
- "Donald Duck" posture

## Causes in Women

### Muscular Imbalances

**Tight muscles:**
- Hip flexors (iliopsoas)
- Erector spinae (lower back)
- Quadriceps

**Weak muscles:**
- Abdominals
- Gluteus maximus
- Hamstrings

### Lifestyle Factors

**Common contributors:**
- Prolonged sitting
- Sedentary lifestyle
- High heel wearing
- Poor exercise habits
- Weak core from inactivity

### Pregnancy and Postpartum

**Why it occurs:**
- Growing belly shifts center of gravity
- Compensatory back arch
- Stretched abdominals
- Relaxed ligaments
- May persist postpartum

### Other Causes

**Contributing factors:**
- Obesity (belly weight)
- Poor postural habits
- Hypermobility
- Spondylolisthesis
- Congenital factors

## Symptoms

### Physical Symptoms

**Common complaints:**
- Lower back pain
- Stiffness in low back
- Pain with prolonged standing
- Muscle fatigue
- Tight hip flexors

### Functional Issues

**Movement problems:**
- Difficulty activating glutes
- Belly looks larger
- Trouble with flat back positions
- Discomfort lying flat
- Lower back fatigue

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Wall test:**
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Heels, buttocks, shoulders touching
3. Check gap at lower back
4. More than flat hand = excessive curve

**Visual assessment:**
- Profile photo
- Check pelvis tilt
- Note belly position
- Compare to ideal alignment

### Professional Evaluation

**When helpful:**
- Persistent back pain
- Symptoms not improving
- Want personalized program
- Rule out other conditions

## Treatment

### The Approach

**Dual focus:**
1. Stretch tight muscles (hip flexors, lower back)
2. Strengthen weak muscles (abs, glutes)
3. Learn neutral pelvis position
4. Address contributing habits

### Hip Flexor Stretches

**Kneeling hip flexor stretch:**
1. Kneel on one knee (pad it)
2. Other foot flat in front
3. Tuck tailbone under
4. Lean forward gently
5. Hold 60 seconds each side

**Thomas stretch:**
1. Sit at edge of bed
2. Hug one knee to chest
3. Lie back
4. Let other leg hang
5. Hold 60 seconds each side

### Lower Back Stretches

**Child's pose:**
1. Kneel, sit back on heels
2. Reach arms forward
3. Round lower back
4. Breathe deeply
5. Hold 2 minutes

**Cat stretch:**
1. On all fours
2. Round back fully
3. Tuck tailbone under
4. Hold 10 seconds
5. Repeat 10 times

### Core Strengthening

**Dead bugs:**
1. Lie on back, arms up
2. Knees bent 90°
3. Lower opposite arm and leg
4. Keep lower back pressed down
5. 10 each side, 3 sets

**Posterior pelvic tilts:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Flatten lower back to floor
3. Engage abs
4. Hold 10 seconds
5. 15 repetitions

**Plank:**
1. Forearms and toes
2. Straight line head to heels
3. Engage core, squeeze glutes
4. Don't let back arch
5. Hold 30-60 seconds

### Glute Strengthening

**Glute bridges:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Squeeze glutes first
3. Then lift hips
4. Don't arch lower back
5. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Hip thrusts:**
1. Shoulders on bench
2. Feet flat on floor
3. Drive through heels
4. Squeeze glutes at top
5. 12 reps, 3 sets

## Daily Management

### Postural Awareness

**Throughout day:**
- Check pelvis position regularly
- Practice posterior tilt standing
- Engage core when standing
- Avoid excessive arch

### Sitting

**When seated:**
- Sit all the way back in chair
- Avoid perching on edge
- Use lumbar support appropriately
- Stand up regularly

### Standing

**When standing:**
- Slight posterior tilt
- Engage glutes gently
- Core lightly activated
- Don't lock knees

## Exercise Modifications

### What to Avoid

**May worsen condition:**
- Excessive back extension
- Heavy overhead pressing (with arch)
- Exercises that increase curve
- Hip flexor dominant movements

### Better Choices

**Helpful exercises:**
- Squats (with neutral spine)
- Romanian deadlifts
- Planks and variations
- Anti-extension core work
- Glute-dominant exercises

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy

**During pregnancy:**
- Some increase is normal
- Focus on maintaining strength
- Modify exercises appropriately
- Prepare for postpartum work

### Postpartum

**Recovery focus:**
- Gradual core rehabilitation
- Address diastasis recti first
- Hip flexor stretching
- Glute reactivation
- Patient progression

## Timeline for Improvement

**With consistent work:**
- 2-4 weeks: Feel hip flexors loosening
- 4-6 weeks: Better awareness of neutral
- 8-12 weeks: Visible improvement
- 3-6 months: Lasting change

## Key Points

1. **Common in women** — Especially after pregnancy
2. **Muscle imbalance** — Tight hip flexors, weak glutes/abs
3. **Address both sides** — Stretch and strengthen
4. **Learn neutral** — Pelvis position awareness
5. **Daily consistency** — Regular small efforts
6. **Modifiable** — With proper approach
