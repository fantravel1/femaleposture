# Sciatica

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve—from the lower back through the hips and buttocks and down each leg. It typically affects only one side and can range from mild aching to severe, debilitating pain.

## Understanding Sciatica

### The Sciatic Nerve

**Anatomy:**
- Largest nerve in the body
- Runs from lower back to feet
- Made of nerve roots from L4-S3
- Supplies sensation and movement
- Branches into leg nerves

### What Causes Sciatica

**Common causes:**
- Herniated disc (most common)
- Spinal stenosis
- Piriformis syndrome
- Spondylolisthesis
- Degenerative disc disease

### Why Women May Be Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Pregnancy-related sciatica
- Piriformis syndrome (common in women)
- Wider pelvic structure
- Hormonal influences
- Carrying bags on one side

## Symptoms

### Classic Presentation

**Typical symptoms:**
- Pain radiating from lower back
- Through buttock and down leg
- Usually one-sided
- Sharp, burning, or electric
- May have numbness or tingling

### Pattern Recognition

**Symptom variations:**
- Worse when sitting
- Better when walking (sometimes)
- Aggravated by coughing/sneezing
- Night symptoms
- Worsened by certain positions

### Severity Levels

**Ranges from:**
- Mild: Occasional discomfort
- Moderate: Interferes with activities
- Severe: Constant, debilitating pain
- Emergency: Loss of bladder/bowel control

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Contributes

**Postural factors:**
- Prolonged sitting compresses spine
- Slouching increases disc pressure
- Muscle imbalances affect alignment
- Hip tightness can irritate nerve
- Poor lifting mechanics

### Specific Posture Issues

**Contributing positions:**
- Prolonged flexed spine
- One-sided standing
- Wallet in back pocket
- Crossing legs habitually
- Sleeping in fetal position too tightly

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Warning signs:**
- Pain down leg past knee
- Numbness or tingling
- Weakness in leg/foot
- Pain worse with sitting
- Relief with certain positions

### When to Seek Help

**Urgent evaluation:**
- Loss of bladder or bowel control
- Sudden severe weakness
- Numbness in groin area
- Rapidly worsening symptoms
- Pain not responding to rest

### Professional Evaluation

**May include:**
- Physical examination
- Neurological testing
- MRI or CT scan
- Nerve conduction studies

## Treatment

### Acute Phase (First 1-2 Weeks)

**Initial management:**
- Relative rest (not bed rest)
- Ice or heat
- Anti-inflammatory medication
- Gentle movement
- Avoid aggravating positions

### Movement and Exercise

**After acute phase:**
- Gentle walking
- Swimming
- Specific stretches
- Core stabilization
- Gradual progression

### Stretches for Sciatica

**Piriformis stretch:**
1. Lie on back
2. Cross affected leg over other knee
3. Pull bottom knee toward chest
4. Hold 30-60 seconds

**Knee to chest:**
1. Lie on back
2. Pull affected knee to chest
3. Keep other leg straight or bent
4. Hold 30 seconds

**Sciatic nerve glide:**
1. Sit on edge of chair
2. Straighten affected leg
3. Point and flex foot slowly
4. 10-15 gentle repetitions

**Figure-4 stretch:**
1. Lie on back
2. Cross ankle over opposite knee
3. Pull toward chest
4. Hold 30-60 seconds

### Core Strengthening

**Stabilizing exercises:**
- Pelvic tilts
- Bridges (if tolerated)
- Dead bugs
- Bird dogs
- Modified planks

### McKenzie Extension

**For disc-related sciatica:**
1. Lie face down
2. Prop on elbows
3. If symptoms centralize (move toward back)
4. Progress to press-ups
5. Do frequently throughout day

**Note:** Only continue if symptoms improve or centralize. Stop if symptoms go further down leg.

## Daily Management

### Sitting

**Best practices:**
- Lumbar support
- Hips slightly higher than knees
- Feet flat on floor
- Regular breaks
- Don't cross legs

### Standing

**Helpful strategies:**
- Weight on both legs
- One foot on stool periodically
- Avoid prolonged standing
- Supportive footwear
- Engage core lightly

### Sleeping

**Position options:**
- Side with pillow between knees
- Back with pillow under knees
- Avoid stomach sleeping
- Supportive mattress

### Driving

**For long trips:**
- Lumbar support
- Regular stops
- Stretch at breaks
- Adjust seat properly

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Manual therapy
- McKenzie method
- Core stabilization
- Nerve mobilization
- Education

### Medical Interventions

**When needed:**
- Oral medications
- Epidural steroid injections
- Nerve blocks
- Surgery (rarely needed)

### Surgery

**Considered when:**
- Conservative treatment fails
- Progressive neurological deficit
- Severe, unrelenting pain
- Loss of function

## Prevention

### Postural Habits

- Maintain good sitting posture
- Regular movement breaks
- Proper lifting technique
- Core strength maintenance
- Flexibility work

### Exercise

**Preventive focus:**
- Regular physical activity
- Core stability
- Hip and back flexibility
- Balanced strength training
- Avoid deconditioning

### Lifestyle

**Additional measures:**
- Maintain healthy weight
- Quit smoking
- Manage stress
- Proper sleep position

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy-Related Sciatica

**Why it occurs:**
- Baby's position may press on nerve
- Postural changes
- Hormonal ligament laxity
- Usually resolves after delivery

**Management:**
- Prenatal physical therapy
- Safe exercises
- Positioning strategies
- Heat for muscle tension

## Key Points

1. **Multiple causes** — Not just disc problems
2. **Posture matters** — Affects disc and nerve
3. **Movement helps** — Relative rest, not bed rest
4. **Central vs peripheral** — Symptoms should centralize
5. **Most improve** — Conservative treatment effective
6. **Seek help if worsening** — Especially with weakness
