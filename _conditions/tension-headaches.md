# Tension Headaches and Posture

Tension headaches are the most common type of headache, and poor posture is a major contributing factor. Forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and neck muscle tension create the muscle imbalances that lead to chronic headache patterns.

## Understanding Tension Headaches

### What They Are

**Characteristics:**
- Band-like pressure around head
- Mild to moderate intensity
- Both sides of head usually
- No nausea or light sensitivity (usually)
- Can last hours to days

### How They Differ from Migraines

**Tension headaches:**
- Pressure, not throbbing
- Both sides of head
- No aura
- Can still function (though uncomfortable)
- Associated with muscle tension

**Migraines:**
- Throbbing, pulsating
- Often one-sided
- May have aura
- May need to lie in dark room
- Nausea and light sensitivity common

### Types

**Episodic tension headaches:**
- Less than 15 days per month
- Often triggered by stress or posture

**Chronic tension headaches:**
- 15+ days per month
- Often posture-related
- May need professional treatment

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Causes Headaches

**Forward head posture:**
- Suboccipital muscles shorten
- These attach to base of skull
- Constant tension = pain referral
- Can feel like headache

**Muscle tension pattern:**
- Upper trapezius becomes tight
- Levator scapulae overactive
- SCM muscle tension
- All can refer pain to head

### Trigger Points

**Common trigger points causing headaches:**
- Upper trapezius → temple and forehead
- Suboccipitals → wrapping around head
- SCM → forehead, eye, ear
- Levator scapulae → angle of neck and head

### Why Women Are More Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Higher stress response
- Hormonal influences
- Jaw clenching patterns
- Carrying tension in shoulders
- Multitasking patterns

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Headache characteristics:**
- Dull, aching pain
- Tightness or pressure
- Across forehead or temples
- Around back of head
- Scalp tenderness

### Associated Symptoms

**Often present:**
- Neck stiffness
- Shoulder tension
- Jaw tightness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Irritability

### Patterns

**Common triggers:**
- End of workday
- After prolonged computer use
- Stress periods
- Poor sleep
- Dehydration

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Ask yourself:**
- Does headache come with neck/shoulder tension?
- Is it worse after computer work?
- Does posture correction help?
- Are there tender spots in neck/shoulders?

### When to See a Doctor

**Seek evaluation if:**
- Sudden severe headache
- Headaches with fever
- Vision changes
- Weakness or numbness
- Worsening pattern
- Not responding to treatment

### Professional Evaluation

**May include:**
- Physical exam of neck and shoulders
- Posture assessment
- Trigger point evaluation
- Rule out other causes

## Treatment: Postural Approach

### Immediate Relief

**When headache starts:**
1. Check posture - correct it
2. Gentle neck stretches
3. Suboccipital release
4. Apply heat to neck
5. Relaxation breathing

### Suboccipital Release

**Self-release technique:**
1. Lie on back
2. Two tennis balls in sock
3. Place at base of skull
4. Let head weight provide pressure
5. Breathe deeply 2-5 minutes

### Neck Stretches

**Upper trapezius stretch:**
1. Sit tall, hold chair with right hand
2. Left hand on right side of head
3. Gently tilt ear toward left shoulder
4. Hold 30 seconds each side

**Levator scapulae stretch:**
1. Look down toward armpit
2. Gentle pressure with hand
3. Hold 30 seconds each side

### Chin Tucks

**Correct forward head:**
1. Sit or stand tall
2. Pull chin straight back
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. Repeat 10-15 times
5. Do throughout day

### Shoulder and Neck Strengthening

**Deep neck flexor activation:**
1. Lie on back
2. Small chin tuck
3. Hold 10 seconds
4. 10 repetitions

**Shoulder blade squeezes:**
1. Sit or stand tall
2. Squeeze shoulder blades together
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. 15 repetitions

## Prevention

### Ergonomic Setup

**Workstation:**
- Screen at eye level
- Close enough to avoid leaning
- Keyboard at elbow height
- Feet flat on floor
- Regular breaks

### Daily Habits

**Prevention strategies:**
- Hourly posture checks
- Regular movement breaks
- Stretching routine
- Stress management
- Adequate hydration

### Sleep Position

**For fewer headaches:**
- Pillow supports neck curve
- Avoid too many pillows
- Don't sleep on stomach
- Supportive mattress

## Lifestyle Factors

### Stress Management

**Reduce muscle tension:**
- Regular exercise
- Relaxation techniques
- Deep breathing
- Adequate sleep
- Boundaries at work

### Jaw Awareness

**TMJ contribution:**
- Notice clenching
- Relax jaw regularly
- Teeth slightly apart at rest
- Avoid gum chewing if sensitive

### Hydration

**Often overlooked:**
- Dehydration triggers headaches
- 8 glasses of water daily
- More with exercise
- Reduce caffeine gradually

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Postural assessment
- Manual therapy
- Dry needling for trigger points
- Exercise prescription
- Ergonomic education

### Other Options

**When needed:**
- Massage therapy
- Chiropractic care
- Acupuncture
- Biofeedback
- Medication (temporary)

## Daily Routine for Prevention

### Morning (5 min)

1. Neck stretches all directions
2. Chin tucks: 10 reps
3. Shoulder rolls: 10 each direction

### Workday (every 2 hours)

1. Posture check and reset
2. Quick neck stretch
3. Stand and move briefly
4. Eye rest (look away from screen)

### Evening (10 min)

1. Full stretching routine
2. Suboccipital release
3. Upper back work
4. Relaxation breathing

## Key Points

1. **Posture is major cause** — Forward head creates muscle tension
2. **Trigger points refer pain** — Neck muscles cause head pain
3. **Prevention works** — Daily habits reduce frequency
4. **Address ergonomics** — Workstation setup matters
5. **Stress contributes** — Mind-body connection
6. **Seek help if chronic** — Don't suffer unnecessarily
