# Quad Dominance

Quad dominance is a movement pattern where the quadriceps work excessively while the glutes underperform. This is common in women and affects posture, movement, and injury risk.

## Understanding Quad Dominance

### The Pattern

- Quads overwork in movements
- Glutes fail to activate properly
- Common in squats, stairs, walking
- Leads to muscle imbalances

### Why Common in Women

- Wider Q-angle
- Hormonal factors
- Movement patterns
- Certain activities

## Effects

### Injury Risk

- ACL injury risk increased
- Patellofemoral pain
- Hip issues
- Hamstring problems

### Posture Impact

- Pelvic position affected
- May contribute to anterior tilt
- Chain effects

## Treatment

### Glute Activation

**Before exercises:**
- Bridges
- Clamshells
- Activate before compound movements

### Movement Retraining

**Focus on:**
- Hip hinge patterns
- Glute-dominant movements
- Proper squat mechanics

## Key Points

1. **Common in women** — Anatomical factors
2. **Injury risk** — Especially ACL
3. **Glute activation key** — Train the glutes
4. **Movement patterns** — Need retraining
