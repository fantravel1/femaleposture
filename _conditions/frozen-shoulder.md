# Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)

Frozen shoulder involves progressive stiffness and pain in the shoulder, with significant loss of range of motion. It's more common in women, especially between ages 40-60, and typically resolves but can take 1-3 years.

## Understanding Frozen Shoulder

### The Condition

**What happens:**
- Shoulder capsule thickens
- Adhesions develop
- Range of motion decreases progressively
- Then gradually returns

### Why Women Are Affected More

**Risk factors:**
- More common in women
- Peak in 40s-50s
- Associated with hormonal changes
- Diabetes increases risk

### Three Stages

**Freezing (2-9 months):**
- Pain increases
- Motion decreases progressively
- Night pain common

**Frozen (4-12 months):**
- Pain may lessen
- Stiffness maximum
- Difficult to move

**Thawing (5-24 months):**
- Motion gradually returns
- Can take 1-2 years
- Usually full recovery

## The Posture Consideration

### During Frozen Shoulder

**Posture may suffer:**
- Protective guarding
- Compensatory movements
- Shoulder hiking
- Upper back rounding

### After Recovery

**Address:**
- Any postural habits that developed
- Restore normal patterns
- Prevent future problems

## Treatment

### During Freezing Stage

**Focus on:**
- Pain management
- Gentle movement
- Heat for comfort
- Avoid forcing

### During Frozen Stage

**Approach:**
- Gentle stretching
- Maintain what motion exists
- Patience
- Physical therapy

### During Thawing Stage

**Progression:**
- More active stretching
- Strengthening as tolerated
- Restore function
- Posture work

## Exercises

### Pendulum Exercises

**Gentle motion:**
- Lean over, arm hangs
- Small circles
- Let gravity assist
- 1-2 minutes

### Passive Stretches

**With assistance:**
- External rotation with stick
- Overhead stretch with other arm
- Table slide stretch

### Strengthening (When Ready)

**As motion returns:**
- Isometrics first
- Progress to resistance
- Full shoulder program

## Key Points

1. **Takes time** — Usually 1-3 years
2. **More common in women** — 40-60 age range
3. **Gentle approach** — Don't force
4. **Usually resolves** — Full recovery expected
5. **Physical therapy helps** — Throughout stages
