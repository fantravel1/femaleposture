# Frozen Shoulder

Adhesive capsulitis causes progressive shoulder stiffness that significantly impacts daily activities and posture.

## Understanding Frozen Shoulder

### What Happens

- Capsule becomes inflamed
- Adhesions form
- Progressive stiffness
- Often three phases

### Posture Effects

- Compensation patterns develop
- Hiking shoulder to reach
- Trunk rotation used
- Upper back stiffens

## Phases

### Freezing Phase

**Characteristics:**
- Pain increasing
- Range decreasing
- 2-9 months typically

### Frozen Phase

**Characteristics:**
- Less pain
- Maximum stiffness
- 4-12 months typically

### Thawing Phase

**Characteristics:**
- Gradual improvement
- Range returns
- 6-24 months typically

## Key Points
