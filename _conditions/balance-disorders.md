# Balance Disorders

Balance relies on multiple systems including inner ear, vision, and proprioception. Posture plays a role in balance, and poor posture can affect stability while balance problems can affect posture.

## The Posture-Balance Connection

### How Posture Affects Balance

**Contributing factors:**
- Forward head shifts center of gravity
- Weak core reduces stability
- Muscle weakness affects reactions
- Poor proprioception

### How Balance Affects Posture

**Compensations:**
- Wider stance for stability
- Guarded movements
- Fear of falling affects posture
- Reduced mobility

## Types of Balance Issues

### Vestibular

**Inner ear-related:**
- BPPV (positional vertigo)
- Vestibular neuritis
- Meniere's disease

### Proprioceptive

**Body awareness:**
- Joint position sense
- Affects with aging
- After injury

### Musculoskeletal

**Strength and flexibility:**
- Weak stabilizers
- Limited ankle mobility
- Core weakness

## Improving Balance

### Exercises

**Balance training:**
- Single-leg standing
- Tandem stance
- Balance board (when ready)
- Tai chi

### Posture Work

**Helps balance:**
- Core strengthening
- Proper alignment
- Body awareness
- Ankle mobility

## Key Points

1. **Multiple systems involved** — Not just ears
2. **Posture affects balance** — Alignment matters
3. **Exercise helps** — Balance is trainable
4. **Seek evaluation** — If sudden onset or severe
