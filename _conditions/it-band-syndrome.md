# IT Band Syndrome

IT band syndrome (ITBS) causes pain on the outside of the knee where the iliotibial band crosses the joint. It's common in runners and cyclists and is often related to hip weakness and poor alignment.

## Understanding ITBS

### What Happens

**The mechanism:**
- IT band becomes tight
- Friction over lateral knee
- Inflammation develops
- Pain with activity

### Common in Women Because

**Contributing factors:**
- Wider Q-angle (hip to knee)
- Hip weakness patterns
- Running and cycling participation
- Footwear choices

## The Hip-IT Band Connection

### Hip Weakness Role

**Key factor:**
- Weak hip abductors
- Poor pelvic control
- Knee collapse inward
- IT band stress increases

### Posture Connection

**Related issues:**
- Pelvic drop during walking/running
- Single-leg stability poor
- Leg alignment problems

## Treatment

### Hip Strengthening (Primary)

**More important than stretching:**

**Clamshells:**
- Side-lying
- 15 reps, 3 sets each side

**Side-lying leg raises:**
- Hip abductor strength
- 15 reps, 3 sets each side

**Single-leg exercises:**
- Balance and stability
- Progress gradually

### Foam Rolling (Careful)

**Approach:**
- Roll above and below painful spot
- Don't roll directly on inflamed area
- Quadriceps and glutes may help more

### Stretching

**IT band stretch:**
- Stand, cross affected leg behind
- Lean away from affected side
- Hold 30 seconds

## Prevention

### Running Form

**Check for:**
- Crossover gait
- Hip drop
- Overstriding

### Gradual Progression

**Prevent with:**
- Slow mileage increases
- Recovery days
- Cross-training

## Key Points

1. **Hip weakness is key** — Strengthen glutes
2. **Not just tight IT band** — Address the cause
3. **Common in women** — Anatomical factors
4. **Rolling carefully** — Not on painful area
5. **Usually responds well** — To hip strengthening
