# Pubic Symphysis Dysfunction (SPD)

Pubic symphysis dysfunction, also called symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD) or pelvic girdle pain (PGP), causes pain in the pubic area, particularly during pregnancy. It occurs when the joint at the front of the pelvis becomes too mobile.

## Understanding SPD

### What Happens

**The mechanism:**
- Pubic symphysis becomes hypermobile
- Relaxin hormone loosens ligaments
- Joint moves more than normal
- Pain with movement

### Why Pregnancy Causes It

**Contributing factors:**
- Relaxin hormone
- Weight of baby
- Postural changes
- Increased stress on pelvis

## Symptoms

### Common Presentation

**Signs:**
- Pain at pubic bone
- Pain spreading to hips/back
- Worse with walking
- Worse with single-leg activities
- Difficulty with stairs

## Management

### Movement Modifications

**Important strategies:**
- Keep knees together when turning in bed
- Avoid single-leg activities
- Stairs one at a time
- Smaller steps when walking
- No breaststroke swimming

### Support

**May help:**
- Pelvic support belt
- SI belt
- Compression shorts

### Exercises

**Helpful:**
- Gentle pelvic floor exercises
- Core stability (modified for pregnancy)
- Hip adductor strengthening
- Avoid aggravating movements

### Posture

**Important:**
- Avoid standing on one leg
- Even weight distribution
- Sit with support
- Avoid crossing legs

## After Delivery

### Recovery

**Usually improves:**
- After hormones normalize
- May take weeks to months
- Strengthening helps recovery
- Physical therapy beneficial

## Key Points

1. **Common in pregnancy** — Due to hormones
2. **Movement modifications key** — Knees together
3. **Support can help** — Pelvic belt
4. **Usually improves** — After pregnancy
5. **Physical therapy helpful** — During and after
