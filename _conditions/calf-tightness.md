# Calf Tightness

Tight calves affect ankle mobility, walking gait, and can contribute to various postural compensations from the ground up.

## Effects on Posture

### Ankle Impact

- Limited dorsiflexion
- Compensatory patterns when walking/squatting
- Knee and hip adjustments

### Common Causes

- High heel wearing
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Running without stretching

## Treatment

### Stretching

**Wall calf stretch:**
- Straight knee for gastrocnemius
- Bent knee for soleus
- Hold 30-60 seconds

### Foam Rolling

- Roll calf muscles
- Target tight spots

## Key Points

1. **Affects ankle mobility** — Foundation of movement
2. **High heels contribute** — Shortened position
3. **Stretching helps** — Both calf muscles
4. **Impacts whole chain** — Ground up effects
