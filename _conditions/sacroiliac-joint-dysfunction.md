# Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction

The sacroiliac (SI) joints connect the sacrum to the pelvis. Dysfunction occurs when these joints move too much or too little, causing pain in the lower back, buttock, and sometimes leg. It's very common in women.

## Understanding SI Joint Issues

### Anatomy

**The SI joints:**
- Connect spine to pelvis
- Transfer forces from upper body to legs
- Have very little movement
- Stabilized by strong ligaments

### Types of Dysfunction

**Hypermobility:**
- Too much movement
- Common during/after pregnancy
- Ligament laxity
- Instability

**Hypomobility:**
- Too little movement
- Joint restriction
- Stiffness
- Often one-sided

### Why Women Are More Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Pregnancy hormones loosen ligaments
- Childbirth stress
- Wider pelvis
- Different loading patterns

## Symptoms

### Typical Presentation

**Common complaints:**
- One-sided low back/buttock pain
- Pain with transitions (sit to stand)
- Pain with single-leg activities
- Difficulty with walking
- May radiate into groin or leg

### Pattern Recognition

**Characteristic features:**
- Point tenderness at SI joint
- Worse with prolonged sitting
- Difficulty with stairs
- Pain rolling in bed
- May click or feel unstable

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Affects SI Joint

**Contributing factors:**
- Standing on one leg
- Asymmetrical activities
- One-sided carrying
- Leg length differences
- Pelvic muscle imbalances

### Pregnancy-Related

**During and after pregnancy:**
- Relaxin loosens ligaments
- Increased stress on joints
- May persist postpartum
- Requires stabilization approach

## Treatment

### Stabilization Approach

**For hypermobility:**
- Core and pelvic stability exercises
- SI belt may help
- Avoid aggravating activities
- Gradual strengthening

### Mobility Approach

**For hypomobility:**
- Joint mobilization
- Stretching
- Movement restoration
- May need professional help

### Core Exercises

**Dead bugs:**
- Core stability
- 10 each side, 3 sets

**Bird dogs:**
- Spinal stability
- 10 each side, 3 sets

**Bridges:**
- Glute and pelvic stability
- 15 reps, 3 sets

### Hip Strengthening

**Clamshells:**
- Hip stability
- 15 each side

**Side-lying leg raises:**
- Hip abductor strength
- 15 each side

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Daily Habits

**To reduce strain:**
- Avoid one-sided activities
- Don't stand on one leg
- Keep knees together sitting
- Use armrests to rise
- Pillow between knees when sleeping

### Pregnancy Considerations

**Extra care:**
- SI belt for support
- Avoid single-leg activities
- Keep knees together getting out of car
- Modified exercises

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Manual therapy
- Stabilization exercises
- Education
- SI belt fitting
- Muscle energy techniques

### Other Options

**When needed:**
- SI joint injection
- Prolotherapy
- Rarely surgery

## Key Points

1. **Very common in women** — Especially during/after pregnancy
2. **Stability is key** — For hypermobile joints
3. **Avoid one-sided activities** — Equal loading helps
4. **Core strength matters** — Stabilizes pelvis
5. **Often responds well** — To conservative treatment
