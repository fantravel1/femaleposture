# Chest Tightness

Tight pectoral muscles pull the shoulders forward, contributing to rounded posture and limiting shoulder mobility. This is extremely common in modern desk workers.

## Understanding Chest Tightness

### The Muscles

**Involved:**
- Pectoralis major
- Pectoralis minor
- Anterior deltoid

### Why It Develops

- Arms forward at desk
- Driving position
- Smartphone use
- Lack of stretching

## Effects

### Posture Impact

- Pulls shoulders forward
- Rounds upper back
- Limits shoulder mobility
- Breathing restriction

### Associated Issues

- Shoulder impingement risk
- Upper back pain
- Neck tension
- Thoracic outlet concerns

## Treatment

### Stretching

**Key stretches:**
- Doorway stretch
- Corner stretch
- Floor pec stretch

### Balance With Strengthening

- Stretch chest AND strengthen back
- Address muscle imbalance

## Key Points

1. **Very common** — Desk work pattern
2. **Pulls shoulders forward** — Creates rounding
3. **Stretching essential** — Regular, sustained
4. **Balance with back work** — Both needed
