# Winging Scapula

Scapular winging occurs when the shoulder blade protrudes from the back rather than lying flat against the ribcage. It can be caused by weakness, nerve issues, or muscle imbalances, and affects shoulder function.

## Understanding Scapular Winging

### Types

**Medial winging:**
- Inner border lifts
- Often serratus anterior weakness
- Most common type

**Lateral winging:**
- Outer border lifts
- Trapezius involvement
- Less common

### Causes

**Contributing factors:**
- Serratus anterior weakness
- Long thoracic nerve injury
- Postural muscle imbalances
- Upper crossed syndrome

## Symptoms

### What You Notice

**Signs:**
- Visible shoulder blade prominence
- Shoulder fatigue
- Difficulty reaching overhead
- May have weakness or pain
- Affects pushing movements

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Contributes

**Related issues:**
- Forward head posture
- Rounded shoulders
- Weak upper back
- Muscle imbalances

## Treatment

### Serratus Anterior Strengthening

**Push-up plus:**
- Regular push-up position
- At top, round upper back
- Protract shoulder blades
- Return to neutral
- 10-15 reps

**Wall slides:**
- Back against wall
- Arms in goalpost position
- Slide up and down
- Keep scapulae flat
- 10-15 reps

### Scapular Stabilization

**Scapular push-ups:**
- Plank position
- Let shoulder blades come together
- Push apart (no arm bend)
- 15 reps

### Postural Exercises

**Also important:**
- Chin tucks
- Rows
- General upper back work

## When to Seek Help

**Important if:**
- Sudden onset
- After injury
- Significant weakness
- Not improving with exercise

May indicate nerve issue requiring evaluation.

## Key Points

1. **Often postural** — Muscle weakness/imbalance
2. **Serratus anterior key** — Needs strengthening
3. **Affects shoulder function** — Worth addressing
4. **Usually responds well** — To specific exercise
5. **Seek evaluation** — If sudden or with weakness
