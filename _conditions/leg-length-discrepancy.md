# Leg Length Discrepancy

Leg length discrepancy (LLD) occurs when one leg is shorter than the other, either structurally or functionally. This can affect pelvic alignment, spinal posture, and contribute to various pain conditions.

## Types

### Structural LLD

**Actual bone difference:**
- One leg truly shorter
- Measurable on imaging
- From fractures, growth issues
- Requires lift consideration

### Functional LLD

**Appears shorter:**
- Muscle imbalances
- Pelvic asymmetry
- Joint restrictions
- May correct with treatment

## Effects on Posture

### Pelvic Impact

**What happens:**
- Pelvis tilts down on short side
- SI joint stress
- Compensatory curves may develop

### Spinal Effects

**Compensations:**
- Functional scoliosis
- Muscle imbalances
- May cause pain patterns

## Treatment

### For Functional LLD

**Address cause:**
- Correct muscle imbalances
- Treat restrictions
- Pelvic alignment work

### For Structural LLD

**May need:**
- Heel lift (if significant)
- Gradual implementation
- Full-length insert sometimes

## When Significant

**Generally concerning:**
- Over 5-10mm may matter
- Individual variation
- Depends on symptoms
- Professional assessment helpful

## Key Points

1. **Two types** — Structural vs functional
2. **Affects pelvis** — May tilt
3. **Functional may correct** — With treatment
4. **Structural may need lift** — If significant
5. **Get assessed** — Determine type and significance
