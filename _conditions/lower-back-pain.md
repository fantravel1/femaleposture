# Lower Back Pain and Posture

> **Overview:** Lower back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 80% of adults at some point. While many factors contribute, poor posture is frequently a significant—and correctable—cause.

---

## How Posture Affects Your Lower Back

Your lower back (lumbar spine) is designed to support your upper body weight. Problems occur when:

- **Excessive lordosis:** Too much curve strains the joints and muscles
- **Flat back:** Too little curve stresses the discs
- **Prolonged sitting:** Compresses discs and weakens muscles
- **Poor lifting:** Strain from bending instead of hinging
- **Asymmetry:** Leaning, crossing legs, uneven weight distribution

---

## Common Posture-Related Causes

### 1. Anterior Pelvic Tilt
- Creates excessive lordosis
- Strains facet joints
- Shortens lower back muscles
- Very common in women

### 2. Weak Core
- Can't stabilize spine during movement
- Back muscles overwork to compensate
- Creates fatigue and strain

### 3. Tight Hip Flexors
- Pull pelvis forward
- Increase lower back curve
- Very common from sitting

### 4. Weak Glutes
- Don't extend hip properly
- Lower back compensates during movement
- Creates chronic strain

## Warning Signs to Watch

**See a doctor if you have:**
- Pain radiating down your leg
- Numbness or tingling
- Bladder or bowel changes
- Severe pain that doesn't improve with rest
- Pain after trauma or fall
- Night pain that wakes you

These symptoms may indicate conditions requiring medical evaluation.

## Self-Help Strategies

### Movement is Medicine

For most lower back pain:
- **Keep moving:** Rest makes it worse
- **Walk daily:** Gentle activity promotes healing
- **Avoid prolonged positions:** Change every 30 minutes
- **Don't fear movement:** Hurt doesn't always mean harm

### Posture Corrections

- **Sitting:** Support your lumbar curve; feet flat on floor
- **Standing:** Weight even on both feet; slight knee bend
- **Sleeping:** Side with pillow between knees; back with pillow under knees
- **Lifting:** Hinge at hips; keep load close to body

## Key Exercises

### For Relief and Prevention

1. **Cat-Cow:** Gentle spinal mobility
2. **Glute Bridges:** Strengthen glutes and teach hip extension
3. **Dead Bugs:** Build core stability safely
4. **Bird Dogs:** Strengthen back without strain
5. **Hip Flexor Stretches:** Release tight hip flexors

### What to Avoid

- Sit-ups and crunches (can worsen many back issues)
- Toe touches (loads spine in flexion)
- Twisting with load
- Anything that increases your specific pain

## When to Seek Help

- Pain significantly affects daily activities
