# Plantar Fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common causes of heel pain, affecting the thick band of tissue (plantar fascia) that runs across the bottom of the foot. While a foot problem, posture and biomechanics throughout the body can contribute.

## Understanding Plantar Fasciitis

### Anatomy

**The plantar fascia:**
- Thick band of connective tissue
- Connects heel to toes
- Supports the arch
- Absorbs shock with walking
- Under significant stress daily

### What Happens

**In plantar fasciitis:**
- Tissue becomes irritated
- May develop microtears
- Inflammation develops
- Pain with weight-bearing
- Especially first steps after rest

### Why Women Are Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Shoe choices (heels, flats)
- Pregnancy-related changes
- Hormonal influences
- Activities and occupations
- Anatomical variations

## The Posture Connection

### Foot as Foundation

**How body affects feet:**
- Hip weakness affects leg alignment
- Knee position affects foot loading
- Ankle mobility affects gait
- Whole chain matters

### Biomechanical Factors

**Contributing issues:**
- Overpronation (flat feet rolling in)
- High arches (poor shock absorption)
- Tight calves
- Hip weakness causing leg rotation
- Leg length differences

### Footwear Impact

**Problematic shoes:**
- High heels (calf tightening)
- Completely flat shoes
- Unsupportive footwear
- Worn-out shoes

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Typical presentation:**
- Stabbing pain in heel
- Worst with first morning steps
- Pain after sitting
- Better with walking (initially)
- May worsen with prolonged standing

### Pattern Recognition

**Characteristic features:**
- Pain decreases with movement initially
- Returns after prolonged activity
- Point tenderness on heel
- Worse on hard surfaces
- May affect one or both feet

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Check for:**
- Pain with first steps after rest
- Tender point on inner heel
- Pain with toe dorsiflexion
- Tight calves
- Pain on hard surfaces

### When to See Doctor

**Seek evaluation if:**
- No improvement in 2-3 weeks
- Severe pain limiting walking
- Signs of infection
- Night pain (may indicate other issues)

## Treatment

### Calf Stretching (Essential)

**Wall calf stretch:**
1. Stand facing wall
2. Affected leg back, knee straight
3. Front knee bent
4. Lean into wall
5. Hold 30-60 seconds, 3 times daily

**Stair stretch:**
1. Stand on step, heels hanging off
2. Lower heels slowly
3. Hold 30-60 seconds
4. Repeat several times daily

### Plantar Fascia Stretch

**Toe pulls:**
1. Sit and cross affected foot over knee
2. Pull toes back toward shin
3. Feel stretch in arch
4. Hold 30 seconds
5. 10 repetitions, 3 times daily

### Arch Strengthening

**Towel scrunches:**
1. Sit with towel under foot
2. Scrunch towel with toes
3. 20 repetitions
4. 3 sets daily

**Short foot exercise:**
1. Stand or sit
2. Draw arch up without curling toes
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. 10 repetitions

### Self-Massage

**Frozen bottle roll:**
1. Freeze water bottle
2. Roll arch over bottle
3. 5-10 minutes
4. Provides massage and ice

**Ball massage:**
1. Golf ball or lacrosse ball
2. Roll under arch
3. 5 minutes
4. Apply moderate pressure

### Hip and Core Strengthening

**Why it helps:**
- Controls leg alignment
- Reduces abnormal foot loading
- Improves overall mechanics

**Exercises:**
- Clamshells
- Side-lying hip abduction
- Single leg balance
- Core stability work

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Footwear

**Good choices:**
- Supportive athletic shoes
- Low-moderate heel drop
- Good arch support
- Proper fit
- Replace when worn

**To avoid:**
- Completely flat shoes
- Very high heels
- Flip-flops for walking
- Worn-out shoes
- Going barefoot on hard surfaces

### Morning Routine

**Before getting up:**
1. Stretch plantar fascia in bed
2. Write alphabet with foot
3. Pull toes back
4. Put shoes on before walking

### Daily Management

**Helpful strategies:**
- Ice after activity
- Supportive shoes always
- Regular calf stretching
- Activity modification during flare
- Night splint if needed

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Manual therapy
- Dry needling
- Exercise prescription
- Gait analysis
- Taping

### Orthotics

**When helpful:**
- Custom or over-the-counter
- Address foot mechanics
- Provide arch support
- Cushion heel

### Other Interventions

**May be considered:**
- Cortisone injection
- Shockwave therapy
- PRP injection
- Night splint
- Surgery (rarely needed)

## Prevention

### Footwear Practices

- Always wear supportive shoes
- Replace shoes regularly
- Avoid sudden changes in footwear
- Consider arch support

### Stretching

- Daily calf stretching
- Plantar fascia stretching
- Before and after exercise
- Especially with prolonged standing

### Exercise Progression

- Gradual increase in activity
- Avoid sudden mileage increases
- Cross-train
- Listen to pain signals

## Key Points

1. **Very common** — Affects many active women
2. **First steps worst** — Classic morning pain
3. **Calf stretching essential** — Most important treatment
4. **Footwear matters** — Supportive shoes help
5. **Takes time** — May need 3-6 months to resolve
6. **Whole body matters** — Hip strength affects foot
