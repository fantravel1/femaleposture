# SI Joint & Sciatica FAQ: Your Questions Answered

> **Quick Answers:** Common questions about SI joint pain and sciatica, two conditions that often affect women and can be connected to posture and life stages.

---

## Understanding SI Joint Dysfunction

### What is the SI joint?

The sacroiliac (SI) joint connects your spine (sacrum) to your pelvis (ilium). You have two SI joints, one on each side. They're designed for stability, not mobility, and transfer force between your upper body and legs.

### What is SI joint dysfunction?

SI joint dysfunction occurs when the joint becomes too loose (hypermobile), too stiff, or inflamed. This causes pain in the lower back, buttock, and sometimes leg.

### What does SI joint pain feel like?

Common descriptions:
- One-sided lower back/buttock pain
- Pain that may radiate into the groin or thigh
- Worse with standing on one leg
- Worse with transitions (sitting to standing)
- May be sharp or aching
- Often worse on one side

### Is SI joint dysfunction the same as sciatica?

No, but they can coexist or be confused:
- **SI joint pain:** Usually stays in low back/buttock/upper thigh
- **Sciatica:** Radiates down the leg, often below the knee, following the sciatic nerve

## Understanding Sciatica

### What is sciatica?

Sciatica is pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve—from your lower back through your buttock and down your leg. It's a symptom of nerve irritation, not a diagnosis itself.

### What causes sciatica?

Common causes:
- Herniated or bulging disc pressing on nerve
- Spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal)
- Piriformis syndrome (muscle compressing nerve)
- Degenerative disc disease
- Pregnancy (temporary compression)

### What does sciatica feel like?

Typical symptoms:
- Sharp, burning, or shooting pain down leg
- Numbness or tingling in leg or foot
- Weakness in leg or foot
- Pain worse with sitting
- Pain may be constant or intermittent
- Usually affects one side

### Is sciatica always from a disc problem?

No. While disc issues are common causes, piriformis syndrome, SI joint problems, and other conditions can cause sciatica-like symptoms.

## Why Women Are Affected

### Why do women get SI joint problems more often?

Women are more susceptible because:
- Hormonal influences (relaxin, estrogen)
- Wider pelvis creates different mechanics
- Pregnancy stretches and stresses the joints
- Childbirth can damage or stretch ligaments
- Different walking/running patterns

### Does pregnancy cause SI joint dysfunction?

Pregnancy significantly increases risk:
- Relaxin hormone loosens ligaments
- Weight gain increases joint load
- Center of gravity shifts
- Delivery can stress the joint

Most pregnancy-related SI issues resolve postpartum, but some persist.

### Can breastfeeding positions cause SI joint pain?

Poor posture during nursing can contribute to SI issues indirectly by creating imbalanced loading. Using proper support and varying positions helps.

### Does menopause affect SI joint health?

Potentially. Decreased estrogen affects joint health and bone density. Some women experience increased joint pain during and after menopause.

## Diagnosis

### How is SI joint dysfunction diagnosed?

Diagnosis typically involves:
- Physical exam with provocation tests
- Medical history (especially pregnancy, injury)
- Ruling out other causes
- Sometimes imaging (X-ray, MRI)
- Diagnostic injection (if exam is unclear)

### How do I know if it's my SI joint or my back?

SI joint pain tends to be:
- Below the belt line
- Often one-sided
- Worse with specific movements (stairs, single-leg stance)
- May be pinpointed with finger

Back pain from disc or spine issues may:
- Be more centralized
- Radiate down the leg in specific patterns
- Be worse with sitting or bending forward

### Should I get imaging for SI pain or sciatica?

Not always needed initially. Imaging is recommended if:
- Symptoms don't improve with treatment
- Red flags present (weakness, bladder changes)
- Surgery is being considered
- Diagnosis is unclear

## Treatment

### How is SI joint dysfunction treated?

Common treatments:
- Physical therapy (very effective)
- SI stabilization exercises
- SI belt (for hypermobility)
- Anti-inflammatory medications
- Manual therapy
- Activity modification
- Injections (for diagnosis or treatment)
- Surgery (rare, last resort)

### How is sciatica treated?

Treatment depends on cause:
- Physical therapy and specific exercises
- Activity modification (not bed rest)
- Pain management
- Posture and body mechanics education
- Stretching (especially piriformis if relevant)
- Medications
- Injections (steroid or other)
- Surgery (for severe or persistent cases)

### Do SI belts really help?

They can help when the SI joint is hypermobile:
- Provide external stability
- Reduce pain with movement
- Allow healing
- Especially helpful during/after pregnancy

They're less useful for stiff SI joints or other causes of pain.

### Will the pain go away on its own?

Sometimes. Many cases of acute SI pain and sciatica improve within weeks to months, especially with appropriate exercise. Chronic cases may need more intervention.

## Exercises and Movement

### What exercises help SI joint dysfunction?

**Stabilization exercises:**
- Glute bridges
- Clamshells
- Bird-dog
- Dead bug
- Pelvic floor strengthening

**Gentle mobility:**
- Pelvic tilts
- Cat-cow
- Gentle hip stretches

**Avoid:** Asymmetric loading, single-leg activities that increase pain

### What exercises help sciatica?

Depends on the cause, but often:
- Piriformis stretching
- Nerve gliding/flossing (carefully)
- Core stabilization
- McKenzie exercises (if disc-related)
- Walking

**Avoid:** Exercises that worsen symptoms

### Is walking good for SI pain and sciatica?

Usually yes:
- Keeps things moving
- Prevents deconditioning
- Low-impact
- Promotes healing

Adjust distance and intensity based on symptoms.

### Can yoga help?

Yoga can help if done carefully:
- Avoid poses that stress the SI joint asymmetrically
- Focus on stability over deep stretching
- Gentle yoga is often better than aggressive practice
- Listen to your body

## Lifestyle Questions

### How should I sleep with SI joint pain or sciatica?

**Side sleeping:**
- Pillow between knees (essential)
- Keeps pelvis aligned
- May need pillow under waist

**Back sleeping:**
- Pillow under knees
- Reduces lumbar curve

**Avoid:** Stomach sleeping; positions that twist pelvis

### Should I avoid sitting?

Not entirely, but:
- Take frequent breaks
- Sit with support
- Avoid slouching
- Consider cushion or lumbar support
- Stand and walk regularly

### Can I exercise with SI pain or sciatica?

Usually yes, with modifications:
- Avoid exercises that worsen symptoms
- Focus on stability and gentle movement
- Swimming and water exercise often help
- Get professional guidance for exercise selection

### When should I see a doctor?

See a provider if:
- Pain is severe or worsening
- You have leg weakness
- Numbness in groin or saddle area
- Bladder or bowel changes
- No improvement after 4-6 weeks of self-care
- Symptoms following trauma

## Pregnancy-Specific Questions

### Is SI pain normal in pregnancy?

Very common. Many pregnant women experience SI pain due to hormones, weight changes, and posture shifts. "Normal" doesn't mean you have to suffer—treatment helps.

### When will pregnancy-related SI pain go away?

Most pregnancy-related SI pain improves within weeks to months after delivery. If it persists, physical therapy focused on SI stabilization is very effective.

### Is sciatica dangerous during pregnancy?

Usually not dangerous, but uncomfortable. True weakness or numbness should be evaluated. Most pregnancy sciatica is temporary due to compression from baby's position.

### Can I wear an SI belt during pregnancy?

Yes, they're commonly recommended and generally safe. A maternity support belt often helps both SI pain and round ligament discomfort.
