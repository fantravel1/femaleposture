# Computer Vision Syndrome

Computer vision syndrome (CVS), also called digital eye strain, includes eye and vision problems from prolonged screen use. It's closely connected to posture, as poor positioning affects both eyes and body.

## Understanding CVS

### Symptoms

**Eye-related:**
- Eye strain and fatigue
- Dry eyes
- Blurred vision
- Headaches
- Difficulty focusing

**Posture-related:**
- Neck pain (from leaning forward)
- Shoulder tension
- Upper back pain

## The Posture Connection

### How They Interact

**Poor posture worsens CVS:**
- Leaning forward to see screen
- Head jutting toward monitor
- Improper screen distance
- Neck strain affects eyes

**CVS worsens posture:**
- Compensating for vision issues
- Moving closer to screen
- Hunching to see better

## Prevention

### Screen Setup

**Proper ergonomics:**
- Screen arm's length away
- Top of screen at eye level
- Reduce glare
- Proper lighting

### The 20-20-20 Rule

**Every 20 minutes:**
- Look at something 20 feet away
- For 20 seconds
- Blink fully

### Posture Awareness

**Important:**
- Sit back in chair
- Screen comes to you (not you to screen)
- Regular posture checks
- Movement breaks

## Treatment

### For Eye Symptoms

**May help:**
- Artificial tears
- Blue light glasses (some benefit)
- Proper prescription
- Rest breaks

### For Posture Symptoms

**Important:**
- Ergonomic setup
- Regular stretches
- Upper back strengthening
- Movement throughout day

## Key Points

1. **Eyes and posture connected** — Affect each other
2. **Ergonomics crucial** — Screen position matters
3. **20-20-20 rule** — Take eye breaks
4. **Movement breaks** — For both issues
5. **Address together** — Best results
