# Osteoporosis & Posture

Osteoporosis—the loss of bone density that makes bones fragile—affects millions of women, especially after menopause. While the disease itself is invisible, its effects on posture can be dramatic and life-altering.

The right approach to posture and exercise can protect your spine, reduce fracture risk, and help you maintain quality of life. The wrong approach can cause serious injury.

This guide covers safe practices for women with osteoporosis or osteopenia (the precursor to osteoporosis).

## Understanding the Risk

### Why Women Are Vulnerable

Women face higher osteoporosis risk due to:
- **Smaller, thinner bones** than men
- **Menopause**: Estrogen loss accelerates bone breakdown
- **Longer lifespan**: More years of bone loss
- **Diet history**: Past dieting, eating disorders
- **Certain medications**: Steroids, some others

### How Osteoporosis Affects Posture

The vertebrae (spine bones) are particularly vulnerable to bone loss:

1. **Weakened vertebrae** can't support load
2. **Compression fractures** occur—sometimes without pain
3. **Vertebral height decreases** (wedge-shaped vertebrae)
4. **Thoracic kyphosis develops** (dowager's hump)
5. **Height loss** occurs (up to several inches)
6. **Breathing and digestion** become compromised

### The Fracture Cascade

One compression fracture makes another more likely:
- First fracture changes spinal mechanics
- More stress on adjacent vertebrae
- Increased fracture risk
- Progressive curve development
- Quality of life decline

**Prevention is critical.**

## Posture Principles for Bone Health

### The Fundamental Rule

**Avoid flexion loading of the spine.**

When you bend forward (spinal flexion) while bearing weight, the front of vertebrae experience compression while the back experiences tension. This is the exact force pattern that causes compression fractures.

**Dangerous:**
- Bending forward to pick things up
- Crunches and sit-ups
- Toe touches
- Many yoga poses
- Slouching while sitting

**Safer:**
- Hinging at hips (not rounding spine)
- Back extension exercises
- Hip flexibility instead of spine flexibility
- Supported positions

### Safe Movement Patterns

**Bending:**
- Always hinge at hips, not spine
- Keep back straight or slightly extended
- Bend knees
- Face what you're picking up

**Lifting:**
- Keep objects close to body
- Use legs, not back
- Never twist while lifting
- Don't lift and bend simultaneously

**Sitting:**
- Maintain lumbar curve
- Use lumbar support
- Avoid slouching
- Get up frequently

**Sleeping:**
- Avoid fetal position (flexed spine)
- Use pillow between knees (side sleeping)
- Support natural curves
- Consider mattress firmness

## Exercises to Avoid

### Absolutely Avoid

These exercises significantly increase fracture risk:

**Flexion exercises:**
- Crunches and sit-ups
- Bicycles
- V-sits
- Roll-ups
- Any curling of spine under load

**High-impact without preparation:**
- Jumping (until bone health improves)
- Running on hard surfaces
- High-impact aerobics
- Jarring activities

**Forward bending:**
- Toe touches
- Standing forward folds (yoga)
- Seated forward folds
- Good mornings (weighted)

**Rotation under load:**
- Russian twists with weight
- Heavy rotational exercises
- Golf and tennis (may need modification)

**High fall risk:**
- Activities on unstable surfaces
- Exercises requiring significant balance (until trained)
- Anything with high injury potential

### Be Cautious With

These require modification or avoidance depending on severity:

- Yoga (many poses need modification)
- Pilates (many exercises need modification)
- Swimming (diving, flip turns)
- Golf (high rotational force)
- Gardening (bending and lifting)

## Safe and Beneficial Exercises

### Weight-Bearing Exercises

Weight-bearing exercise stimulates bone formation:

**Walking:**
- Safe for most
- Start with flat surfaces
- Good footwear essential
- Progress gradually

**Stair climbing:**
- Builds bone in hips and spine
- Hold railing for safety
- Start with a few stairs

**Dancing (low-impact):**
- Social and physical benefits
- Choose styles without jumping
- Avoid spins if balance is concern

**Elliptical/Cross-trainer:**
- Weight-bearing with reduced impact
- Safe for most stages
- Build up gradually

### Resistance Training

Muscle pulling on bone stimulates bone growth:

**Upper body:**
- Rows (strengthens upper back)
- Lat pulldowns
- Bicep curls
- Tricep extensions
- Chest press (not chest fly)

**Lower body:**
- Squats (to safe depth)
- Leg press
- Leg extensions
- Leg curls
- Calf raises

**Important guidelines:**
- Start with light weight
- Progress slowly
- Focus on posture during exercises
- Work with trained professional initially

### Posture-Specific Exercises

#### Prone Back Extension (Safe and Important)

1. Lie face down on mat
2. Hands under shoulders or by sides
3. Gently lift head and chest
4. Keep neck neutral
5. Hold 5-10 seconds
6. Lower with control
7. 10 repetitions

**Why this helps:** Strengthens back extensors that fight kyphosis

#### Standing Back Extension

1. Stand tall, hands on lower back
2. Gently arch backward
3. Support with hands
4. Hold 3-5 seconds
5. Return to neutral
6. 10 repetitions throughout day

**Why this helps:** Counteracts forward bending throughout day

#### Wall Angels

1. Stand with back against wall
2. Arms in "goalpost" position against wall
3. Slide arms up and down
4. Keep arms and back in contact with wall
5. 10-15 repetitions

**Why this helps:** Opens chest, strengthens upper back, improves thoracic extension

#### Scapular Squeezes

1. Sit or stand tall
2. Squeeze shoulder blades together
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. Release
5. 15-20 repetitions

**Why this helps:** Strengthens muscles that prevent rounded shoulders

#### Hip Hinge Practice

1. Stand with feet hip-width
2. Hands on hips or stick along spine
3. Push hips back, keeping spine straight
4. Knees slightly bent
5. Return to standing
6. 10 repetitions

**Why this helps:** Learns safe bending pattern that protects spine

### Balance Training

Falls are the primary cause of fractures. Balance training is essential:

**Single leg stance:**
- Stand near wall for safety
- Lift one foot slightly
- Hold 10-30 seconds
- Progress to eyes closed

**Tandem stance:**
- Heel to toe position
- Hold 30 seconds
- Progress difficulty gradually

**Weight shifting:**
- Shift weight side to side
- Shift weight forward and back
- Maintain control throughout

**Tai Chi:**
- Excellent for balance
- Evidence for fall reduction
- Low impact
- Avoid deep flexion poses

## Daily Life Adaptations

### Safe Lifting Technique

**Squat lift:**
1. Face the object
2. Squat down, keeping spine straight
3. Grip object securely
4. Exhale as you stand using legs
5. Keep object close to body

**Half-kneeling lift:**
1. Kneel on one knee
2. Bring object close
3. Push up through front leg
4. Use for heavier items

**Avoid:**

- Won't correct structural curves
- May help with pain management
- Don't rely on them exclusively

**Thoracic support brace:**
- May be prescribed post-fracture
- Use as directed by physician
- Temporary use typically
- Combined with exercise

### Pain Management

**Acute fracture pain:**
- Medical evaluation essential
- Rest in comfortable position
- Pain medication as prescribed
- Gentle movement when cleared

**Chronic postural pain:**
- Extension exercises often help
- Heat or ice as preferred
- Massage may provide relief
- Physical therapy beneficial

## Working with Healthcare Providers

### Your Medical Team

**Endocrinologist or internist:** Manages medication, monitors bone density
**Physical therapist:** Designs safe exercise program
**Primary care provider:** Coordinates care
**Orthopedist:** If fractures occur

### Questions to Ask

- What is my current bone density status?
- Am I at high risk for fracture?
- What exercises are safe for me specifically?
- Should I avoid any activities?
- How should I modify yoga/Pilates?
- Do I need a physical therapy referral?

### Before Starting Exercise

- Get medical clearance
- Understand your specific risks
- Work with trained professional initially
- Learn proper technique before progressing

## Medication and Lifestyle

### Building Bone Through Lifestyle

**Nutrition:**
- Adequate calcium (1200mg daily 50+)
- Vitamin D (800-1000 IU daily)
- Adequate protein
- Limit alcohol
- Avoid excessive salt

**Lifestyle:**
- Weight-bearing exercise regularly
- Resistance training
- Fall prevention
- Smoking cessation

### Medication Considerations

Many women with osteoporosis take bone-building medications. These work best with:
- Consistent weight-bearing exercise
