# Forward Head Posture (Tech Neck)

> **Overview:** Forward head posture (FHP), also called tech neck, occurs when your head sits forward of your shoulders rather than directly above them. This common condition affects up to 66% of adults and is highly correctable with consistent exercise.

## What Is Forward Head Posture?

In ideal posture, your ear should align directly over your shoulder when viewed from the side. With forward head posture, the ear sits noticeably in front of the shoulder.

**Why it matters:** Your head weighs 10-12 pounds. For every inch it moves forward, an additional 10 pounds of strain is placed on your neck muscles. A head 3 inches forward creates 30+ pounds of constant strain.

## Common Causes

- **Smartphone use:** Hours of looking down at screens
- **Computer work:** Leaning toward monitors
- **Prolonged sitting:** Weakens postural muscles
- **Poor workstation setup:** Monitors too low or far away
- **Weak upper back muscles:** Can't maintain proper position
- **Tight chest muscles:** Pull shoulders and head forward

---

## Symptoms

- Neck pain and stiffness
- Tension headaches (base of skull)
- Upper back pain
- Shoulder blade pain
- Jaw tension (TMJ)
- Reduced breathing capacity
- Fatigue and difficulty concentrating

## Quick Self-Assessment

**The Wall Test:**
1. Stand with back against a wall
2. Heels 2 inches from wall
3. Buttocks and shoulder blades touching wall
4. Does your head naturally touch the wall?

**Results:**
- Head touches wall = normal alignment
- 1-inch gap = mild FHP
- 2-inch gap = moderate FHP
- 3+ inch gap = significant FHP

## Treatment Approach

Forward head posture typically responds well to:

1. **Corrective exercises:** Chin tucks, upper back strengthening
2. **Stretching:** Chest and neck muscles
3. **Ergonomic changes:** Workstation and phone habits
4. **Postural awareness:** Regular position checks

Most people see significant improvement within 4-12 weeks of consistent practice.
