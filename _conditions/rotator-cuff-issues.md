# Rotator Cuff Issues

The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that stabilize and move the shoulder. Problems range from tendinitis to partial or complete tears. Posture significantly affects rotator cuff health and recovery.

## Understanding the Rotator Cuff

### The Four Muscles

**SITS muscles:**
- Supraspinatus
- Infraspinatus
- Teres minor
- Subscapularis

### Types of Problems

**Range of issues:**
- Tendinitis/tendinopathy
- Impingement
- Partial tears
- Full tears

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Affects Rotator Cuff

**Rounded shoulders:**
- Reduces subacromial space
- Increases impingement risk
- Changes muscle function
- Accelerates wear

### Forward Head Posture

**Also contributes:**
- Associated with rounded shoulders
- Affects scapular position
- Increases shoulder strain

## Symptoms

### Common Signs

**Presentation:**
- Pain with overhead movement
- Night pain (lying on shoulder)
- Weakness
- Difficulty reaching behind back
- Pain at side of shoulder

## Treatment

### Posture Correction

**Essential:**
- Must address rounded shoulders
- Upper back strengthening
- Chest stretching
- Scapular stability

### Rotator Cuff Exercises

**When appropriate:**
- External rotation
- Internal rotation
- Scapular strengthening
- Progressive loading

### When Surgery Is Needed

**Considerations:**
- Full tears often need repair
- Partial tears may heal
- Failed conservative care
- Depends on age, activity level

## Key Points

1. **Posture is key factor** — Rounded shoulders contribute
2. **Address scapula** — Not just rotator cuff
3. **Progressive loading** — Important for healing
4. **Tears may need surgery** — Especially full tears
5. **Prevention possible** — With good posture and strength
