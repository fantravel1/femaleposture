# Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)

Repetitive strain injuries develop from repeated motions over time, common in office work and many occupations. Posture plays a significant role in both cause and prevention.

## Understanding RSI

### What It Is

- Carpal tunnel syndrome
- Tendinitis
- Tennis/golfer's elbow
- De Quervain's tenosynovitis

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Contributes

**Mechanisms:**
- Poor positioning increases strain
- Awkward postures stress tissues
- Static positions cause fatigue
- Compound stress on tissues

### Work Posture Issues

**Common problems:**
- Forward head position
- Elevated shoulders
- Wrist deviation
- Reaching for mouse/keyboard

## Prevention

### Ergonomic Setup

**Essential:**
- Proper keyboard/mouse position
- Screen at correct height
- Chair at right height
- Armrests appropriately used

### Work Practices

**Important habits:**
- Regular breaks

- Ergonomic correction
- Don't push through pain

### Professional Help

**When needed:**
- Physical therapy
- Ergonomic assessment
- Splinting
- Medical evaluation

## Key Points

1. **Prevention best** — Ergonomics and breaks
2. **Posture matters** — Affects loading patterns
3. **Don't ignore symptoms** — Early treatment better
4. **Workplace setup** — Critical for prevention
