# Degenerative Disc Disease

Degenerative disc disease (DDD) refers to changes in spinal discs that occur with age and wear. While called a "disease," it's actually a normal part of aging—though posture and activity levels influence its progression and symptoms.

## Understanding DDD

### What Happens to Discs

**Normal aging changes:**
- Discs lose water content
- Become less flexible
- Height decreases
- May develop tears
- Shock absorption decreases

### Who Gets Symptoms

**Not everyone with DDD has pain:**
- Many have changes with no symptoms
- Disc changes don't equal pain
- Other factors influence pain
- Posture and activity matter

### Why Women May Be Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Hormonal changes (especially menopause)
- Osteoporosis can accompany DDD
- Pregnancy stresses on spine
- Different activity patterns

## Symptoms

### When Symptomatic

**May experience:**
- Low back or neck pain
- Worse with sitting
- Worse with bending/twisting
- Better with movement
- Stiffness after rest

### Pain Patterns

**Typical characteristics:**
- Comes and goes
- Flares with certain activities
- May radiate but usually local
- Morning stiffness
- Improves with gentle movement

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Affects Discs

**Poor posture increases:**
- Disc pressure (slouched sitting)
- Uneven loading
- Accelerated wear
- Symptom frequency

**Good posture provides:**
- Even disc loading
- Neutral spine alignment
- Less stress on structures
- Better symptom management

## Treatment

### Movement Is Key

**Best approach:**
- Stay active
- Avoid prolonged positions
- Regular exercise
- Core strengthening
- Flexibility maintenance

### Exercise Guidelines

**Helpful activities:**
- Walking
- Swimming
- Core exercises
- Low-impact activities
- Movement variety

### Posture Practices

**Daily habits:**
- Neutral spine awareness
- Regular position changes
- Ergonomic setup
- Lifting with good form

## Key Points

1. **Part of aging** — Not a "disease" really
2. **Changes don't equal pain** — Many have changes without symptoms
3. **Movement helps** — Stay active
4. **Posture matters** — Affects disc loading
5. **Manageable** — Most do well with conservative care
