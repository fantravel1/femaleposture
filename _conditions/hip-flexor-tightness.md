# Hip Flexor Tightness

Tight hip flexors are extremely common, especially in those who sit frequently. This affects pelvic position, lower back health, and overall posture, making it a key area to address.

## Understanding Hip Flexor Tightness

### What Gets Tight

**Main muscles:**
- Iliopsoas (primary)
- Rectus femoris
- TFL

### Why It Happens

**Common causes:**
- Prolonged sitting
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Lack of stretching
- Running without stretching
- Weak glutes (compensatory)

## Effects on Posture

### Pelvic Impact

**What happens:**
- Pulls pelvis into anterior tilt
- Increases lower back curve
- Changes whole alignment

### Chain Effects

**May contribute to:**
- Lower back pain
- Hip pain
- Hamstring "tightness" (actually long)
- Poor glute activation

## Treatment

### Stretching

**Key stretches:**

**Kneeling hip flexor stretch:**
- Kneel on one knee
- Tuck tailbone under
- Lean forward
- Hold 60+ seconds each side

**Couch stretch:**
- Back foot on couch
- Front foot forward
- Maintain neutral spine
- Hold 60 seconds each side

### Strengthening

**Also important:**
- Glute strengthening
- Core activation
- Address weaknesses too

### Daily Habits

**Reduce sitting:**
- Stand periodically
- Walking breaks
- Don't sit in same position for hours

## Key Points

1. **Very common** — Especially in sitters
2. **Affects pelvic tilt** — Creates anterior tilt
3. **Stretching essential** — Long holds needed
4. **Strengthen too** — Glutes and core
5. **Change sitting habits** — Prevention
