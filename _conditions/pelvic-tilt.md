# Pelvic Tilt: Understanding Your Foundation

> **Overview:** Your pelvis is the foundation of your spine. When it tilts excessively forward (anterior) or backward (posterior), it affects your entire posture chain—from lower back to neck. Both types are correctable with the right exercises.

## Types of Pelvic Tilt

### Anterior Pelvic Tilt (APT)

The most common type—the front of your pelvis drops down and back of pelvis rises.

**Appearance:**
- Exaggerated curve in lower back (lordosis)
- Belly pushes forward
- Buttocks stick out ("duck butt")
- Often called "Instagram posture"

**Common causes:**
- Prolonged sitting
- Tight hip flexors
- Weak glutes and abs
- High heel wearing

### Posterior Pelvic Tilt (PPT)

The opposite—the front of pelvis tilts up and back tilts down.

**Appearance:**
- Flat lower back
- Tucked tailbone
- Flat buttocks
- Slouched overall appearance

**Common causes:**
- Tight hamstrings
- Weak lower back muscles
- Certain sitting habits
- Over-cueing "tuck your tailbone"

## Self-Assessment

### The Wall Test

1. Stand with back against wall
2. Heels 2-3 inches from wall
3. Buttocks and upper back touching wall
4. Check the gap at your lower back

**Interpretation:**
- **Small gap (1-2 inches):** Neutral pelvis - normal
- **Large gap (hand slides through):** Likely anterior pelvic tilt
- **No gap (lower back flat against wall):** Likely posterior pelvic tilt

### The Mirror Test

Stand sideways in front of a mirror:
- Look at the curve of your lower back
- Note the position of your belly
- Observe your tailbone position

## Why Pelvic Position Matters

Your pelvis affects:
- **Lower back:** Excessive tilt strains the lumbar spine
- **Hip function:** Alters muscle length and strength
- **Knee position:** Changes force distribution
- **Upper body:** Compensatory changes all the way up the spine

Many people with chronic lower back pain have pelvic alignment issues.

## Treatment Approach

### For Anterior Pelvic Tilt

1. **Stretch:** Hip flexors (they're pulling your pelvis forward)
2. **Strengthen:** Glutes and abs (to pull pelvis back to neutral)
3. **Core training:** Learn to maintain neutral pelvis

**Key exercises:**
- Hip flexor stretches
- Glute bridges
- Dead bugs
- Plank variations

### For Posterior Pelvic Tilt

1. **Stretch:** Hamstrings (they're pulling your pelvis down)
2. **Strengthen:** Lower back and hip flexors
3. **Mobility:** Thoracic and hip extension work

**Key exercises:**
- Hamstring stretches
- Hip flexor strengthening
- Lower back extension
- Thoracic mobility
