# Sciatica Exercises: Stretches and Movements for Relief

> **Important Note:** Sciatica has different causes, and what helps one person may worsen another's symptoms. Start gently and stop any exercise that increases your pain.

---

## Understanding Sciatica and Exercise

### Why Exercise Helps

Movement can help sciatica by:
- Reducing inflammation
- Improving blood flow to the nerve
- Preventing muscle weakness
- Maintaining flexibility
- Reducing stiffness

### Why Some Exercises Hurt

Certain movements may:
- Put pressure on the nerve
- Stretch tissues that are already irritated
- Worsen underlying causes (disc, stenosis)

This is why personalized guidance from a professional is valuable.

---

## Finding What Works for You

### The Direction Preference

Some people feel better with:
- **Extension (bending backward):** Often helps disc-related sciatica
- **Flexion (bending forward):** May help stenosis-related sciatica
- **Neutral movements:** Help when both directions irritate

Test gently. If an exercise brings relief or centralizes pain (moves it toward the back and out of the leg), it's often helpful. If it spreads pain further down the leg, stop.

## Exercises That Often Help

### 1. Piriformis Stretch

*Especially helpful if piriformis syndrome is the cause*

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Cross right ankle over left knee
3. Pull left knee toward chest
4. Feel stretch deep in right buttock
5. Hold 30-60 seconds
6. Switch sides

**Tip:** If this worsens symptoms, try a gentler version or skip it.

---

### 2. Knee to Chest

*Gently stretches lower back*

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back
2. Bring one knee toward chest
3. Hold behind thigh or on shin
4. Keep other leg bent or straight
5. Hold 20-30 seconds
6. Switch sides
7. Then try both knees together

**Caution:** If this increases leg symptoms, stop.

---

### 3. Press-Up (McKenzie Extension)

*Often helps disc-related sciatica*

**How to do it:**
1. Lie face down
2. Place hands beside shoulders
3. Press up, lifting chest while keeping hips on floor
4. Straighten arms if comfortable (or stay on forearms)
5. Hold briefly, lower
6. Repeat 10 times

**Key:** Pain should centralize (move toward back) or decrease. If pain spreads down leg, stop.

---

### 4. Cat-Cow (Gentle)

*Spinal mobility without extreme positions*

**How to do it:**
1. On hands and knees
2. Gently arch back (cow)
3. Gently round back (cat)
4. Move slowly
5. Don't push into painful ranges
6. 10 gentle cycles

---

### 5. Sciatic Nerve Glide

*Mobilizes the nerve without aggressive stretching*

**How to do it:**
1. Sit on chair, back supported
2. Straighten affected leg
3. Point and flex foot slowly
4. Optional: Add gentle neck movement (look up as you point, down as you flex)
5. 10-15 repetitions
6. Should be gentle, not painful

**Caution:** This should be very gentle. Stop if symptoms increase.

---

### 6. Pelvic Tilts

*Gentle core activation and back mobilization*

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Flatten lower back into floor (tilt pelvis back)
3. Then arch back slightly (tilt pelvis forward)
4. Move slowly between positions
5. 15-20 repetitions

---

### 7. Bird-Dog (Modified)

*Core stability without loading spine*

**How to do it:**
1. On hands and knees
2. Extend one arm forward only
3. Return, extend other arm
4. Then extend one leg back only
5. Progress to opposite arm and leg together (if tolerated)
6. 8-10 each side

---

### 8. Glute Bridges

*Strengthens glutes without loading spine*

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Press through heels, lift hips
3. Squeeze glutes at top
4. Lower with control
5. 10-15 repetitions

---

### 9. Walking

*Often the best exercise for sciatica*

**Why it helps:**
- Low-impact
- Promotes circulation
- Gentle movement
- Can be done at any intensity

**How:** Start with short walks (5-10 minutes). Increase as tolerated. Walk at a pace that doesn't worsen symptoms.

## Exercises to Approach with Caution

### Forward Bends

- Can worsen disc-related sciatica
- Test gently; stop if symptoms increase
- May help stenosis-related sciatica

### Straight Leg Raises

- Can stretch the irritated nerve
- May worsen symptoms
- Use with caution, if at all

### Heavy Lifting

- Increases spinal load
- Wait until symptoms improve
- When returning, use perfect form

### High-Impact Activities

- Running, jumping, etc.
- Wait until significant improvement
- Return gradually

### Prolonged Sitting

- Not an exercise, but worth noting
- Often worsens sciatica
- Take frequent breaks

## Sample Routine

### Gentle Daily Routine (10-15 minutes)

**Warm-up:**
- Walking in place: 2 minutes
- Pelvic tilts: 15 reps

**Stretching:**
- Knee to chest: 30 sec each side
- Piriformis stretch: 45 sec each side
- Press-up (if it helps): 10 reps

**Strengthening:**
- Bird-dog: 8 each side
- Glute bridges: 12 reps

**Mobility:**

## Progression Guidelines

### Acute Phase (Pain is high)

- Gentle movements only
- Walking as tolerated
- Avoid anything that worsens symptoms
- Focus on finding comfortable positions

### Subacute Phase (Pain decreasing)

## When These Exercises Aren't Enough

### See a Professional If:

- Pain is severe or worsening
- You have significant weakness
- Numbness affects function
- Bladder or bowel symptoms (emergency)
- No improvement after 2-4 weeks of self-care
- You're unsure what's causing your sciatica

### What a Professional Can Offer:

- Accurate diagnosis of the cause
- Personalized exercise prescription
- Manual therapy
- Other treatments as needed

## Prevention After Recovery

Once symptoms resolve:

- Maintain core and hip strength
- Stay active
- Address posture issues
- Avoid prolonged sitting
- Lift properly

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I exercise through sciatica pain?

Gentle movement is usually beneficial, but you shouldn't push through significant pain. Exercise that worsens symptoms or spreads pain down the leg is too much.

### How often should I do these exercises?

Most can be done daily. Listen to your body. If soreness develops, rest a day.

### Is stretching or strengthening more important?

Both have their place. In acute phases, gentle movement and specific stretches often help. As you recover, strengthening becomes more important for prevention.

### Can exercise make sciatica worse?

Yes, if you do the wrong exercises or push too hard. That's why gentle testing and stopping if symptoms worsen is important.
