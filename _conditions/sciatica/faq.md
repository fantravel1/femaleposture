## Understanding Sciatica

### What exactly is sciatica?

Sciatica is pain that travels along the sciatic nerve pathway—from your lower back, through your hip and buttock, and down the back of each leg. It's a symptom, not a diagnosis itself. Something is irritating or compressing the sciatic nerve.

### What causes sciatica?

Common causes:
- **Herniated disc:** Most common cause
- **Spinal stenosis:** Narrowing of the spinal canal
- **Bone spurs:** Bony growths on vertebrae
- **Piriformis syndrome:** Muscle compressing nerve
- **Degenerative disc disease:** Wear and tear
- **Spondylolisthesis:** Vertebra slipping forward

Less common causes:
- Tumors
- Infection
- Trauma

### What does sciatica feel like?

Sciatica can feel like:
- Sharp, shooting pain
- Burning sensation
- Electric shock feeling
- Numbness
- Tingling
- Weakness in leg
- Aching pain
- Pain that worsens with sitting

**Typically affects one side only.**

### Where do you feel sciatica pain?

The sciatic nerve travels:
- From lower back
- Through buttock
- Down back of thigh
- Into lower leg (back and outside)
- Sometimes to foot

You might feel symptoms anywhere along this path.

## Symptoms and Diagnosis

### How do I know if it's sciatica or something else?

**Suggests sciatica:**
- Pain follows nerve path (back, buttock, leg)
- One-sided symptoms
- Worse with sitting
- Electric/burning quality
- Numbness or tingling

**May be something else:**
- Both legs affected
- No leg symptoms (just back)
- Pain in front of thigh
- Pain in both buttocks equally

**Always good to get proper diagnosis from a professional.**

### When should I see a doctor for sciatica?

See a doctor if:
- Severe pain
- Sudden onset after injury
- Pain worsening despite rest
- Numbness or weakness progressing
- Bladder or bowel problems (emergency)
- Pain with fever
- Unexplained weight loss
- Previous cancer history

**Cauda equina syndrome** (bladder/bowel loss, numbness in saddle area) is a medical emergency.

### Do I need imaging (MRI, X-ray)?

Not always. Many cases resolve with conservative treatment. Imaging is typically recommended if:
- Symptoms don't improve in 4-6 weeks
- Significant weakness
- Bladder/bowel symptoms
- Surgery is being considered
- Red flags present

### What doctor should I see?

Starting points:
- Primary care physician
- Physical therapist (can often be seen directly)

Specialists if needed:
- Orthopedic surgeon
- Neurosurgeon
- Physiatrist (rehabilitation medicine)
- Neurologist

## Treatment Questions

### Will sciatica go away on its own?

Many cases do improve on their own:
- Most resolve within 4-6 weeks
- About 80% improve with conservative treatment
- Some people have recurring episodes
- Chronic sciatica (lasting >12 weeks) less likely to self-resolve

### What helps sciatica pain?

**Movement (when tolerable):**
- Gentle walking
- Swimming
- Avoid prolonged sitting
- Avoid complete bed rest

**Physical therapy:**
- Specific exercises
- Stretching
- Core strengthening
- Nerve mobilization

**Pain management:**
- Over-the-counter pain relievers
- Ice or heat
- Medications from doctor
- Injections in some cases

**Posture and ergonomics:**
- Proper sitting position
- Lumbar support
- Avoiding aggravating positions

### Should I use ice or heat for sciatica?

Both can help differently:

**Ice:**
- Good for acute inflammation
- First 48-72 hours
- 15-20 minutes at a time

**Heat:**
- Relaxes muscles
- Better for muscle-related component
- After initial phase

**Some people prefer one over the other—experiment.**

### Is bed rest good for sciatica?

**No.** While some rest may be needed initially, prolonged bed rest:
- Weakens muscles
- Stiffens spine
- Doesn't help recovery
- May worsen symptoms

**Better approach:**
- Stay as active as tolerated
- Gentle movement
- Avoid positions that aggravate
- Gradually increase activity

## Exercise and Activity

### Should I exercise with sciatica?

Yes, appropriate exercise usually helps:
- Keep moving within comfort
- Walking often well-tolerated
- Swimming/water exercise
- Gentle stretching
- Physical therapy exercises

**Avoid:**
- Heavy lifting
- High-impact activities
- Movements that increase pain
- Prolonged sitting

### What exercises help sciatica?

Often helpful:
- **Piriformis stretches**
- **Hamstring stretches** (gentle)
- **Cat-cow**
- **Knee-to-chest**
- **Core strengthening** (when ready)
- **Nerve glides** (under guidance)

What's best depends on the cause. A physical therapist can personalize recommendations.

### What exercises make sciatica worse?

Often aggravating:
- Forward bending (for disc issues)
- Heavy deadlifts or squats
- Sit-ups/crunches
- High-impact activities
- Prolonged stretching of the sciatic nerve

**Important:** This varies by individual and cause.

### Can I still walk with sciatica?

Usually yes, and it's recommended:
- Walking keeps things moving
- Reduces stiffness
- Promotes healing
- Better than sitting

**Modifications:**
- Shorter distances if needed
- Slower pace
- Stop if symptoms worsen significantly

## Recovery and Prevention

### How long does sciatica last?

Varies widely:
- **Acute:** Days to 6 weeks
- **Most cases:** 4-6 weeks with conservative treatment
- **Some:** Several months
- **Chronic:** >12 weeks

**Factors affecting recovery:**
- Cause of sciatica
- Severity
- Treatment approach
- General health
- Consistency with treatment

### Will sciatica come back?

It can. To reduce recurrence:
- Maintain core strength
- Good posture habits
- Regular exercise
- Healthy weight
- Proper lifting technique
- Address underlying cause

### How do I prevent sciatica?

Prevention strategies:
- **Exercise regularly:** Core and back strength
- **Good posture:** Sitting and standing
- **Proper lifting:** Bend knees, keep load close
- **Healthy weight:** Reduces spine stress
- **Ergonomic workspace:** Proper setup
- **Take breaks:** From prolonged positions
- **Flexibility:** Hip and lower back stretching

### Can sciatica cause permanent damage?

Rarely, but possible if:
- Severe compression left untreated
- Cauda equina syndrome (emergency)
- Prolonged significant weakness

**Most cases resolve without lasting issues with appropriate treatment.**

## Posture and Daily Life

### Does posture affect sciatica?

Yes. Poor posture can:
- Increase pressure on discs
- Tighten muscles that compress nerve
- Change spinal alignment
- Worsen symptoms

**Good posture helps by:**
- Reducing disc pressure
- Keeping spine aligned
- Relaxing muscle tension

### What's the best position for sciatica?

Often helpful:
- **Lying on back:** Knees bent, pillow under knees
- **Lying on side:** Pillow between knees
- **Standing:** Weight evenly distributed
- **Sitting:** Lumbar support, feet flat, frequent breaks

**Varies by individual and cause.**

### How should I sleep with sciatica?

Tips:
- Try back sleeping with pillow under knees
- Side sleeping with pillow between knees
- Supportive mattress
- Avoid stomach sleeping
- Experiment with positions

### Can sitting cause sciatica?

Prolonged sitting:
- Increases disc pressure
- Tightens hip flexors
- Compresses buttock area
- Can worsen or trigger symptoms

**If you must sit:**
- Use lumbar support
- Take frequent breaks
- Maintain good posture
- Consider standing desk
