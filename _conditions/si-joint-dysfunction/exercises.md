# SI Joint Exercises: Stabilization and Pain Relief

> **Stability Is Key:** The SI joint needs stability, not flexibility. The right exercises strengthen the muscles that support this joint while gently improving mobility.

---

## Understanding SI Joint Exercise

### What the SI Joint Needs

- Stability more than mobility
- Balanced muscle support
- Proper pelvic alignment
- Core and glute strength

### Exercise Goals

1. Reduce pain
2. Stabilize the joint
3. Correct muscle imbalances
4. Improve function
5. Prevent recurrence

---

## Stabilization Exercises

### Pelvic Tilts

**Why:** Builds awareness and gentle control

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Flatten lower back to floor (posterior tilt)
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. Gently arch back (anterior tilt)
5. Find neutral between extremes
6. 10-15 reps

### Transverse Abdominis Activation

**Why:** Deep core support for SI joint

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Find neutral spine
3. Draw belly button toward spine (not sucking in)
4. Hold while breathing normally
5. 10 second holds, 10 reps
6. Progress to holding during other exercises

### Bridge

**Why:** Glute strength stabilizes pelvis

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat
2. Engage core and squeeze glutes
3. Lift hips until straight line from knees to shoulders
4. Hold 3-5 seconds
5. Lower with control
6. 10-15 reps

**Key:** Don't overarch at top. Keep core engaged.

### Clamshell

**Why:** Strengthens hip abductors (gluteus medius)

**How to:**
1. Lie on side, knees bent 45 degrees
2. Keep feet together
3. Lift top knee, keeping pelvis stable
4. Don't roll backward
5. 15-20 reps each side

### Bird-Dog

**Why:** Core stability with minimal SI joint stress

**How to:**
1. Hands and knees position
2. Engage core
3. Extend opposite arm and leg
4. Keep back flat—don't rotate
5. Hold 5-10 seconds
6. Alternate sides, 8-10 each

### Dead Bug

**Why:** Core control with supine position

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, arms reaching up
2. Knees over hips, bent 90 degrees
3. Flatten back to floor
4. Slowly lower opposite arm and leg
5. Return and switch
6. 8-10 each side

## Gentle Mobility Exercises

### Knee-to-Chest (Single)

**Why:** Gentle stretch for lower back and hip

**How to:**
1. Lie on back
2. Bring one knee toward chest
3. Hold behind thigh
4. Keep other leg bent on floor
5. Hold 20-30 seconds
6. Switch sides

**Caution:** Both knees together may stress SI joint—do one at a time.

### Supine Piriformis Stretch

**Why:** Releases piriformis that can affect SI joint

**How to:**
1. Lie on back
2. Cross right ankle over left knee
3. Gently pull left thigh toward chest
4. Feel stretch in right buttock
5. Hold 30 seconds
6. Switch sides

### Supine Twist (Gentle)

**Why:** Gentle rotational mobility

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, arms out
2. Both knees bent, feet on floor
3. Let knees fall to one side
4. Keep shoulders down
5. Only go as far as comfortable
6. Hold 20-30 seconds each side

**Note:** May not be tolerated by all—skip if it increases pain.

### Hip Flexor Stretch

**Why:** Tight hip flexors can affect pelvic alignment

**How to:**
1. Half-kneeling position
2. Tuck tailbone under
3. Shift weight forward gently
4. Feel stretch in front of hip
5. Hold 30 seconds
6. Switch sides

## Exercises to Approach Carefully

### May Aggravate Some People

- Pigeon pose (deep hip stretch)
- Deep lunges
- Single-leg standing exercises (initially)
- High-impact activities
- Asymmetrical loading

### Individual Response

What aggravates varies by person. Pay attention to your body and avoid exercises that increase pain.

## Sample Routines

### Acute Phase (Pain Present)

**Gentle, 10 minutes:**

1. Pelvic tilts: 10 reps (gentle)
2. TA activation: 10 x 10 seconds
3. Single knee-to-chest: 20 sec each
4. Bridge: 5-8 reps (if tolerated)
5. Gentle walking: 5-10 minutes

### Building Phase (Pain Improving)

**15-20 minutes, every other day:**

1. Pelvic tilts: 10 reps
2. TA activation: 10 holds
3. Bridges: 10-12 reps
4. Clamshells: 15 each side
5. Bird-dog: 8 each side
6. Hip flexor stretch: 30 sec each
7. Piriformis stretch: 30 sec each

### Maintenance Phase (Prevention)

**20-25 minutes, 3x/week:**

1. Walking warm-up: 5 minutes
2. Bridges: 15 reps (or single-leg)
3. Clamshells with band: 15 each
4. Bird-dog: 10 each side
5. Dead bug: 10 each side
6. Side plank: 20-30 sec each
7. All stretches: 30 sec each
8. Walking: 10-15 minutes

## Progression Guidelines

### Week 1-2

- Focus on pain relief
- Gentle exercises only
- Build body awareness
- Avoid aggravating activities

### Week 3-4

- Add strengthening exercises
- Increase reps gradually
- Begin balance challenges

### Week 5+

- Progress to resistance
- Single-leg exercises
- More dynamic movements
- Return to normal activities

---

## Exercises to Build To

Once stable and pain-free:

### Single-Leg Bridge

- One foot lifted
- Bridge on one leg
- Tests and builds stability

### Standing Balance

- Single-leg stance
- Progress to eyes closed
- Add movement (leg swing)

### Resistance Band Work

- Band around thighs for bridges
- Band for clamshells
- Adds challenge to stabilizers

### Light Squats and Lunges

- When ready
- Start partial range
- Focus on symmetry

---

## What to Avoid

### During Acute Phase

- Heavy lifting
- Twisting under load
- Deep stretches
- Single-leg loading
- High-impact activities

### General Precautions

- Asymmetrical loading
- Sleeping with twisted posture
- Prolonged one-legged standing
- Activities that increase pain

---

## When to Modify or Stop

### Modify If:

- Exercise causes more than mild discomfort
- Pain lingers after exercise
- You notice compensating with other muscles

### Stop and Consult If:

- Pain increases significantly
- Symptoms not improving after 4-6 weeks
- Numbness or tingling develops
- Pain radiates down leg

---

## Additional Support

### Heat/Ice

- Heat before exercise (relaxes muscles)
- Ice after if any inflammation

### SI Belt

- Can provide support during exercise
- Ask provider about use

### Manual Therapy

Physical therapy for:
- Joint mobilization
- Muscle release
- Guided exercise progression
