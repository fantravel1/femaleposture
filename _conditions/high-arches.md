# High Arches (Pes Cavus)

High arches, or cavus foot, occurs when the foot arch is higher than normal. This creates a rigid foot that doesn't absorb shock well, potentially affecting posture and causing pain.

## Understanding High Arches

### Characteristics

**What happens:**
- Excessive arch height
- Rigid foot structure
- Less shock absorption
- Weight on heel and ball of foot

### Causes

**Contributing factors:**
- Genetic/inherited
- Neurological conditions
- Muscle imbalances
- May be progressive

## Effects on Posture

### Poor Shock Absorption

**Impact:**
- More stress on joints
- May affect knees, hips, back
- Fatigue with standing/walking

### Supination Pattern

**Alignment:**
- Ankle rolls outward
- Different loading pattern
- May affect leg alignment

## Treatment

### Footwear

**Important features:**
- Good cushioning
- Flexibility
- Avoid motion control
- May need wider forefoot

### Orthotics

**Custom often needed:**
- Accommodate arch
- Provide cushioning
- Distribute pressure

### Stretching

**May help:**
- Calf stretching
- Plantar fascia stretching
- Improve flexibility

## Key Points

1. **Rigid foot type** — Less flexible
2. **Poor shock absorption** — Affects joints
3. **Cushioning important** — In footwear
4. **Custom orthotics** — Often helpful
5. **May need evaluation** — If progressive or neurological
