# Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) occurs when nerves or blood vessels are compressed in the space between the collarbone and first rib. Poor posture—particularly rounded shoulders and forward head—is a major contributing factor, making this condition increasingly common.

## Understanding Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

### Anatomy

**The thoracic outlet:**
- Space between collarbone and first rib
- Brachial plexus nerves pass through
- Subclavian artery and vein pass through
- Small space, many structures

**What gets compressed:**
- Nerves (most common - neurogenic TOS)
- Veins (venous TOS)
- Arteries (arterial TOS)

### Why Women Are Affected More

**Contributing factors:**
- Narrower thoracic outlet
- Shoulder structure
- Breast weight pulling forward
- Muscle development differences
- Higher rates of hypermobility

### Types of TOS

**Neurogenic TOS (95% of cases):**
- Nerve compression
- Pain, numbness, tingling
- Weakness in hand

**Venous TOS:**
- Vein compression
- Arm swelling
- Bluish discoloration

**Arterial TOS:**
- Artery compression
- Cold hand
- Weak pulse (rare)

## Causes

### Postural Factors

**Primary contributors:**
- Forward head posture
- Rounded shoulders
- Drooping shoulders
- Elevated first rib
- Tight scalene muscles

### Anatomical Factors

**Structural issues:**
- Extra cervical rib
- Abnormal first rib
- Tight fibrous bands
- Muscle anomalies

### Other Causes

**Contributing factors:**
- Repetitive overhead movements
- Carrying heavy bags
- Trauma/injury
- Prolonged arm positioning
- Sleeping positions

## Symptoms

### Neurogenic Symptoms

**Common complaints:**
- Numbness in arm, hand, fingers
- Tingling (often 4th and 5th fingers)
- Pain in neck, shoulder, arm
- Weakness in hand grip
- Symptoms worse with arm overhead

### Pattern Recognition

**Characteristic patterns:**
- Symptoms worse when arms raised
- Relief when arms supported
- Worse with carrying bags
- Night symptoms common
- Aggravated by certain positions

### Vascular Symptoms

**Less common but serious:**
- Arm swelling
- Color changes (pale or blue)
- Cold sensitivity
- Weak pulse
- Visible vein distension

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Tests

**Roos test (EAST):**
1. Arms at 90° (surrender position)
2. Open and close hands 3 minutes
3. Positive if symptoms reproduce

**Adson's test:**
- Extend neck, turn head to affected side
- Deep breath
- Check pulse changes

**Wright's test:**
- Arm overhead and externally rotated
- Check for pulse changes or symptoms

### Imaging

**When needed:**
- X-ray for cervical rib
- MRI for soft tissue
- Ultrasound for vascular issues
- Nerve conduction studies

## Posture Connection

### How Posture Causes TOS

**Forward head posture:**
- Scalene muscles shorten
- Nerves compressed between scalenes
- Reduced space in outlet

**Rounded shoulders:**
- Pectoralis minor tightens
- Compresses nerves and vessels
- Pulls clavicle down

**Drooping shoulders:**
- Increases compression
- Stretches brachial plexus
- Reduces thoracic outlet space

## Treatment

### Postural Correction

**Priority interventions:**
- Correct forward head
- Open chest and shoulders
- Strengthen upper back
- Improve thoracic mobility

### Stretches

**Scalene stretch:**
1. Sit tall, hold chair with affected side
2. Tilt head away from affected side
3. Rotate chin up slightly
4. Hold 30 seconds

**Pectoralis minor stretch:**
1. Doorway with arm at 90°
2. Step through
3. Rotate body away
4. Hold 30 seconds

**First rib mobilization:**
1. Sit with towel over shoulder
2. Pull down on towel
3. Side-bend head away
4. Deep breathing

### Strengthening

**Scapular retraction:**
1. Squeeze shoulder blades
2. Down and back
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. 15 repetitions

**Chin tucks:**
1. Pull chin straight back
2. Hold 5 seconds
3. 15 repetitions

**Lower trapezius strengthening:**
1. Prone Y raises
2. Focus on lower trap
3. 10 reps, 3 sets

### Nerve Gliding

**Median nerve glide:**
1. Arm at side
2. Extend wrist and fingers
3. Abduct arm slowly
4. Turn head away if tolerated
5. 10 gentle repetitions

**Ulnar nerve glide:**
1. Arm at side
2. Flex elbow
3. Extend wrist
4. Abduct arm
5. 10 gentle repetitions

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Daily Habits

**Avoid:**
- Heavy shoulder bags
- Sleeping on affected side
- Arms overhead for prolonged periods
- Carrying weight in arms
- Poor sitting posture

**Instead:**
- Use backpack (both straps)
- Sleep with arm supported
- Take breaks from overhead work
- Use carts for heavy items
- Ergonomic workstation

### Work Modifications

**Ergonomic changes:**
- Screen at eye level
- Keyboard at proper height
- Arm rests on chair
- Document holder
- Headset for phone calls

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**Typically includes:**
- Postural assessment
- Manual therapy
- Exercise prescription
- Nerve mobilization
- Ergonomic education

### Other Interventions

**When needed:**
- Massage therapy
- Botox injections (for muscle spasm)
- Pain management
- Surgery (rarely, for structural causes)

## When to Seek Help

### Warning Signs

**Urgent evaluation if:**
- Significant arm swelling
- Color changes in arm
- Severe weakness
- Rapidly worsening symptoms
- Signs of blood clot

### Conservative Treatment Timeframe

**Expect improvement:**
- 6-12 weeks with consistent therapy
- Some cases take longer
- Surgery rarely needed
- Most improve with posture correction

## Prevention

### Postural Practices

- Regular posture checks
- Strengthen upper back
- Stretch chest daily
- Avoid prolonged forward positions
- Ergonomic awareness

### Exercise Choices

- Swimming (backstroke)
- Yoga (with modifications)
- Pilates
- Rowing exercises
- Upper back work

## Key Points

1. **Posture is major factor** — Forward head and rounded shoulders
2. **More common in women** — Anatomical and lifestyle factors
3. **Conservative treatment first** — Physical therapy effective
4. **Address root cause** — Postural correction essential
5. **Avoid aggravating activities** — Heavy bags, overhead work
6. **Seek help if worsening** — Don't ignore progressive symptoms
