# Swayback Posture

Swayback posture occurs when the hips push forward beyond the line of the ankles while the upper body leans backward to compensate. It's different from hyperlordosis and often called "lazy" or "slouchy" posture.

## Understanding Swayback

### What It Looks Like

**Characteristics:**
- Hips thrust forward
- Upper body leans back
- Hanging on ligaments
- Long curve through upper back
- Lower back may be flat or curved

### Different from Hyperlordosis

**Key distinctions:**
- Swayback: Hips forward of ankles
- Hyperlordosis: Excessive lumbar curve
- Swayback: Often flat or minimal low back curve
- Hyperlordosis: Pronounced arch

### Why It Develops

**Common reasons:**
- Standing with locked knees
- Fatigue or laziness
- Weak core muscles
- Habit from leaning on surfaces
- Poor body awareness

## Causes

### Muscular Factors

**Weakness in:**
- Deep core muscles
- Hip flexors
- Upper back muscles

**Tightness in:**
- Upper abdominals
- Hamstrings sometimes
- Internal obliques

### Habits

**Contributing behaviors:**
- Standing on one leg
- Leaning into counters
- Locked knees
- Passive standing

## Symptoms

### What You May Notice

**Common complaints:**
- Lower back discomfort
- Hip pain
- Poor balance
- Fatigue with standing
- Neck strain

## Correction

### Body Awareness

**First step:**
- Understand neutral alignment
- Stack hips over ankles
- Don't push hips forward
- Soft knees

### Exercise Approach

**Focus on:**
- Core activation
- Hip flexor strengthening
- Postural awareness
- Glute engagement

### Key Exercises

**Dead bugs:**
- Core activation
- 10 each side

**Standing hip flexion:**
- Lift knee against resistance
- 10 each side

**Wall reference:**
- Stand against wall
- Feel proper alignment
- Step away and maintain

## Key Points

1. **Different from lordosis** — Hips forward, not excessive curve
2. **Often fatigue posture** — Hanging on ligaments
3. **Core weakness** — Major contributor
4. **Awareness helps** — Understanding proper alignment
5. **Correctable** — With exercise and attention
