# Shoulder Bursitis

Subacromial bursitis causes shoulder pain with overhead movements and often develops from poor posture habits.

## Understanding Shoulder Bursitis

### What Happens

- Bursa becomes inflamed
- Space narrowed with movement
- Pain with reaching overhead
- Night pain common

### Posture Connection

- Rounded shoulders narrow space
- Forward head increases risk
- Scapular position matters
- Often work-related

## Treatment

### Posture Correction

**Key changes:**
- Open chest posture
- Scapular positioning
- Workstation setup
- Regular breaks

### Strengthening

**Target muscles:**
- Rotator cuff
- Scapular stabilizers
- Upper back
- Core support

## Key Points

1. **Posture related** — Rounded shoulders narrow space
2. **Common in desk workers** — Static postures contribute
3. **Strengthen rotator cuff** — Supports shoulder
4. **Address workspace** — Ergonomic setup helps
