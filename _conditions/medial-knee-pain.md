# Medial Knee Pain

Medial knee pain affects the inner aspect of the knee and often relates to leg alignment and muscle imbalances.

## Understanding Medial Knee Pain

### What Happens

- Inner knee structures stressed
- Multiple possible causes
- Alignment factors involved
- Muscle imbalances contribute

### Posture Connection

- Knee valgus increases stress
- Hip weakness involved
- Foot mechanics matter
- Overall leg alignment

## Common Causes

### Pes Anserine Bursitis

**Characteristics:**
- Tender below inner knee
- Worse with stairs
- Common in women
- Related to hamstring tightness

### MCL Strain

**Characteristics:**
- Pain along inner knee
- Instability possible
- Often from injury
- Ligament stress

## Risk Factors

### Contributing Factors

**Common factors:**
- Knock-knee alignment
- Overweight
- Tight hamstrings
- Weak hip abductors

### Women's Risk

**Higher prevalence:**
- Wider pelvis angle
- Knee valgus tendency
- Hormonal factors

## Management

### Strengthening Focus

**Key areas:**
- Hip abductors
- Quadriceps
- Core stability
- Hamstring flexibility

### Alignment Work

**Address:**
- Hip strength for knee alignment
- Foot mechanics
- Gait pattern
- Movement quality

## Key Points

1. **Alignment matters** — Check whole leg
2. **Hip strength key** — Controls knee position
3. **Common in women** — Q angle factors
4. **Address flexibility** — Hamstring tightness
