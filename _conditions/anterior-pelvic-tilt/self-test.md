# Pelvic Tilt Self-Assessment: Check Your Alignment

> **Why It Matters:** Your pelvis is the foundation of your spine. When it tilts excessively forward (anterior tilt) or backward (posterior tilt), it affects everything above and below it.

---

## Understanding Pelvic Tilt

### Anterior Pelvic Tilt (APT)

- Belt line angles down in front
- Excessive lower back arch
- Belly often pushes forward
- Butt appears to stick out

### Posterior Pelvic Tilt (PPT)

- Belt line angles up in front
- Flat lower back
- Tucked-under appearance
- Flattened buttock appearance

### Neutral Pelvis

- Level belt line
- Natural, moderate lower back curve
- Balanced appearance
- What we're aiming for

## Test 1: Wall Test

*The most common pelvic tilt assessment*

### How to Do It

1. Stand with back against a wall
2. Heels about 2-3 inches from wall
3. Buttocks and upper back touch the wall
4. Stand naturally—don't adjust

### What to Check

**Measure the space between your lower back and the wall:**

- Slide your hand, palm facing wall, behind your lower back
- Note how much space there is

### Interpreting Results

| Space | Likely Indicates |
|-------|------------------|
| Flat (no space) | Possible posterior tilt |
| One hand thickness | Normal/neutral |
| More than one hand | Possible anterior tilt |

**Note:** Some variation is normal. This is a general guide, not a diagnosis.

## Test 2: Belt Line/Waistband Check

*Quick visual assessment*

### How to Do It

1. Stand naturally in front of a mirror (side view)
2. Wear pants or shorts with a defined waistband
3. Look at the angle of your waistband

### What to Look For

**Anterior Pelvic Tilt:**
- Front of waistband sits lower than back
- Waistband angles downward in front

**Posterior Pelvic Tilt:**
- Front of waistband sits higher than back
- Waistband angles upward in front

**Neutral:**
- Waistband roughly level
- Slight forward angle is normal

---

## Test 3: Lying Down Assessment

*Removes standing compensations*

### How to Do It

1. Lie on your back on a firm surface
2. Legs extended
3. Let your body relax completely
4. Don't try to correct anything

### What to Check

**Lower back space:**
- Slide your hand under your lower back
- Note the space between back and floor

**Leg/hip position:**
- Where do your legs naturally fall?
- Does your lower back arch significantly when legs are straight?

### Interpreting Results

**Anterior tilt signs:**
- Significant arch in lower back (large space)
- Lower back lifts off floor when legs straighten

**Posterior tilt signs:**
- Lower back pressed flat into floor
- Little to no space under lower back

**Neutral:**
- Moderate curve—hand fits snugly but doesn't slide easily

---

## Test 4: Thomas Test (Hip Flexor Tightness)

*Tight hip flexors often cause anterior pelvic tilt*

### How to Do It

1. Sit on edge of table or firm bed
2. Pull one knee to chest with both hands
3. Slowly lie back, keeping that knee pulled in
4. Let the other leg hang naturally

### What to Watch

**Look at the hanging leg:**

- **Thigh drops below table level:** Good hip flexor flexibility
- **Thigh stays horizontal:** Normal
- **Thigh rises above horizontal:** Tight hip flexors (suggests APT)
- **Knee extends (straightens):** Tight rectus femoris specifically

### Repeat on Both Sides

Note any differences between left and right.

---

## Test 5: Prone Hip Extension Test

*Tests glute strength relative to lower back*

### How to Do It

1. Lie face down
2. Arms at sides or under forehead
3. Keep leg straight
4. Slowly lift one leg a few inches
5. Have someone watch OR video yourself

### What to Watch

**Ideal:** Leg lifts without lower back arching first

**APT sign:** Lower back arches before leg lifts
- Indicates glute weakness
- Lower back compensating

Repeat on both sides.

## Combining Test Results

### Likely Anterior Pelvic Tilt If:

- ✓ Large space at wall test
- ✓ Waistband angles down in front
- ✓ Significant arch when lying down
- ✓ Tight hip flexors (Thomas test)
- ✓ Back arches before leg lifts

### Likely Posterior Pelvic Tilt If:

- ✓ No space at wall test
- ✓ Waistband angles up in front
- ✓ Flat back when lying down
- ✓ Hip flexors not tight
- ✓ May have tight hamstrings

### Likely Neutral If:

- ✓ Moderate space at wall
- ✓ Level waistband
- ✓ Natural curve lying down
- ✓ Balanced flexibility

## Important Considerations

### Normal Variation

- Some degree of lumbar curve is normal and healthy
- Not everyone needs to be "textbook perfect"
- Aim for your comfortable neutral, not an arbitrary standard

### Women-Specific Factors

- Women naturally tend toward slightly more anterior tilt
- This is due to pelvic structure differences
- Pregnancy temporarily increases anterior tilt
- Don't over-correct to complete flatness

### What Affects Results

- Time of day (more tilt when tired)
- What you wore that day (heels increase APT)
- How long you sat before testing
- Acute vs. chronic patterns

## What to Do With Your Results

### If You Have Anterior Pelvic Tilt

Focus on:
1. Stretching hip flexors
2. Strengthening glutes
3. Strengthening core (especially lower abs)
4. Reducing prolonged sitting
5. See [APT Exercises](/conditions/anterior-pelvic-tilt/exercises/)

### If You Have Posterior Pelvic Tilt

Focus on:
1. Stretching hamstrings
2. Strengthening hip flexors (moderately)
3. Strengthening lower back (carefully)
4. Improving hip flexor awareness
5. Consult a professional for guidance

### If You're Close to Neutral

Maintain with:
1. General exercise variety
2. Movement throughout day
3. Occasional stretching
4. Core strength maintenance

## When to See a Professional

Consider professional assessment if:
- Significant pain accompanies pelvic tilt
- One hip is noticeably higher than other
- Symptoms don't improve with exercises
- You're unsure of your results
- You have other spine or hip conditions

A physical therapist can perform more detailed assessments and create a personalized plan.
