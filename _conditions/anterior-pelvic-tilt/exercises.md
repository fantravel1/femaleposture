# 5 Daily Exercises to Correct Anterior Pelvic Tilt

> **The Goal:** Anterior pelvic tilt (APT) comes from an imbalance—tight hip flexors and lower back pulling your pelvis forward, weak glutes and abs not pulling it back. These exercises address all four areas.

---

## Understanding the Imbalance

### What's Tight (Needs Stretching)

- **Hip flexors** (psoas, rectus femoris)
- **Lower back muscles** (erector spinae)

### What's Weak (Needs Strengthening)

- **Glutes** (gluteus maximus)
- **Abdominals** (especially deep core)
- **Hamstrings** (secondary)

The exercises below target all of these in a balanced routine.

## The Daily Routine (15 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Hip Flexor Stretch

*Stretches the tight front of hip*

**Time:** 60 seconds each side

**How to do it:**
1. Kneel with right foot forward, left knee on floor (padded)
2. Keep torso upright
3. Tuck tailbone under (posterior tilt—this is key!)
4. Squeeze left glute
5. Shift weight forward until you feel stretch in front of left hip
6. Hold 60 seconds
7. Switch sides

**Key point:** The tailbone tuck is essential. Without it, you're not actually stretching the hip flexor effectively.

**For deeper stretch:**
- Raise left arm overhead
- Lean slightly away from left hip

---

### Exercise 2: Glute Bridges

*Strengthens glutes and teaches posterior tilt*

**Reps:** 3 sets of 12

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat on floor
2. Feet hip-width apart, close to buttocks
3. Press through heels, lifting hips toward ceiling
4. Squeeze glutes hard at top
5. Don't arch lower back—keep it neutral
6. Lower with control
7. Repeat

**Key point:** Initiate with glutes, not lower back. If you feel it more in your back than your glutes, reset your form.

**Progression:**
- Hold at top for 3-5 seconds
- Single-leg bridges
- Add weight on hips

---

### Exercise 3: Dead Bug

*Strengthens deep core while teaching pelvic control*

**Reps:** 3 sets of 8 each side

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back, arms extended toward ceiling
2. Lift legs, knees bent 90 degrees (tabletop position)
3. Press lower back into floor (this is the core engagement)
4. Slowly lower right arm and left leg toward floor
5. Keep lower back pressed down—if it arches, you've gone too far
6. Return to start
7. Repeat with left arm and right leg
8. Continue alternating

**Key point:** The lower back must stay pressed into the floor throughout. This teaches your core to control your pelvis.

**Regression:** Only lower legs, keeping arms still.

---

### Exercise 4: Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch with Posterior Tilt

*Combines stretching with core activation*

**Time:** 45 seconds each side

**How to do it:**
1. Kneeling lunge position (like Exercise 1)
2. Tuck tailbone under strongly
3. Engage abs—draw belly button toward spine
4. Squeeze back-leg glute
5. You should feel this in front of back hip AND in your abs
6. Hold 45 seconds
7. Switch sides

**Why this variation:** It's like Exercise 1 but with more emphasis on posterior tilt and core engagement. It teaches the correct pelvic position.

---

### Exercise 5: Supine Pelvic Tilts

*Teaches conscious control of pelvic position*

**Reps:** 20 slow reps

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat
2. Arms at sides
3. Slowly tilt pelvis backward (flatten lower back into floor)
4. Then tilt pelvis forward (arch lower back—small gap from floor)
5. Move slowly and deliberately between positions
6. Focus on the feeling of each position
7. 20 full cycles

**Purpose:** This exercise builds awareness. You're learning to feel and control your pelvic position—a skill you'll use standing and sitting.

**Progression:** Practice the posterior tilt and hold for 10 seconds.

## Quick Reference Card

| Exercise | Target | Time/Reps |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Hip Flexor Stretch | Stretch hip flexors | 60 sec × 2 sides |
| Glute Bridges | Strengthen glutes | 3 × 12 |
| Dead Bug | Strengthen core + control | 3 × 8 each side |
| Hip Flexor + Posterior Tilt | Stretch + activate | 45 sec × 2 sides |
| Supine Pelvic Tilts | Awareness + control | 20 reps |

**Total Time: ~15 minutes**

## Programming Tips

### When to Do This Routine

**Best times:**
- Morning (sets pelvis for the day)
- After prolonged sitting
- Before or after workouts
- Evening before bed

**Frequency:** Daily for first 4-6 weeks, then 4-5x/week for maintenance

### Progression Over Time

**Weeks 1-2:**
- Focus on form
- Build awareness
- Establish habit

**Weeks 3-4:**
- Increase hold times on stretches
- Add reps/sets to exercises
- Focus on quality

**Weeks 5+:**
- Add single-leg bridges
- Increase dead bug complexity
- Maintain hip flexor stretches
- Add plank variations

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Arching Back During Bridges

**Problem:** Using lower back instead of glutes
**Fix:** Keep ribs down, focus on glute squeeze

### Mistake 2: Not Tucking Tailbone During Hip Flexor Stretch

**Problem:** Missing the actual stretch
**Fix:** Posterior pelvic tilt before leaning forward

### Mistake 3: Letting Back Arch During Dead Bug

**Problem:** Loses core benefit
**Fix:** Smaller range of motion; keep back pressed to floor

### Mistake 4: Rushing Through Exercises

**Problem:** Loses effectiveness
**Fix:** Slow, controlled movements; quality over quantity

## Additional Exercises to Consider

Once you've mastered the basics, add:

- **Bird-dog:** Core stability
- **Clamshells:** Glute medius strength
- **Planks:** Core endurance (avoid sagging)
- **Romanian deadlifts:** Hamstring strengthening
- **Standing pelvic tilts:** Apply awareness to standing

---

## What to Expect

### Week 1-2
- Exercises feel challenging
- May be sore in new areas
- Starting to understand the movements

### Week 3-4
- Exercises become easier
- Beginning to notice pelvic position more often
- May feel different when standing

### Week 5-8
- Standing feels more natural in neutral
- Lower back discomfort (if present) improving
- Exercises are routine

### Month 2-3
- Visible changes in posture
- Habits forming
- Maintenance becomes focus

---

## When This Isn't Enough

See a professional if:
- Exercises cause pain
- No improvement after 6-8 weeks
- You have other symptoms (numbness, leg pain)
- You're unsure of your form

A physical therapist can assess your specific situation and provide personalized guidance.
