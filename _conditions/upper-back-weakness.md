# Upper Back Weakness

Weak upper back muscles (rhomboids, middle/lower traps, rear deltoids) fail to counteract forward-pulling forces, leading to rounded shoulders and forward head posture.

## Understanding Upper Back Weakness

### Key Muscles

**Postural muscles:**
- Rhomboids
- Middle trapezius
- Lower trapezius
- Posterior deltoid
- Deep spinal muscles

### Why It Happens

- Prolonged sitting
- Desk work
- Not training back muscles
- Imbalanced exercise programs

## Effects

### Posture Impact

- Rounded shoulders
- Forward head
- Increased kyphosis
- Upper crossed syndrome

### Associated Issues

- Neck pain
- Shoulder problems
- Headaches
- Breathing restriction

## Treatment

### Strengthening

**Essential exercises:**
- Rows (all types)
- Face pulls
- Reverse flies
- Y-T-W exercises

### Volume Needed

- More pulling than pushing
- Regular training
- Progressive overload

## Key Points

1. **Common from sitting** — Desk work pattern
2. **Must train intentionally** — Doesn't happen automatically
3. **Balance with pushing** — 2:1 or 3:2 ratio
4. **Affects posture directly** — Key for alignment
