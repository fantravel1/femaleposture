# Anxiety and Posture

Anxiety and posture have a bidirectional relationship—anxiety affects how we hold our bodies, and our posture can influence anxiety levels. Understanding this connection offers a physical approach to managing anxious feelings.

## The Body-Mind Connection

### How Anxiety Affects Posture

**Physical manifestations:**
- Shoulders rise toward ears
- Curling inward protectively
- Shallow chest breathing
- Making oneself smaller
- Muscle tension throughout

### How Posture Affects Anxiety

**Research shows:**
- Slumped posture increases negative thoughts
- Upright posture improves mood
- Open postures reduce stress hormones
- Expansive positions increase confidence
- Body feeds back to brain

## Anxiety-Related Posture Patterns

### Common Patterns

**Protective positioning:**
- Rounded shoulders
- Crossed arms
- Head down
- Collapsed chest
- Tight jaw

### Why These Develop

**Evolutionary response:**
- Protecting vulnerable areas
- Making self smaller (less threat)
- Guarding vital organs
- Tension for "readiness"

## Using Posture to Reduce Anxiety

**Expansive positions:**
- Take up appropriate space
- Shoulders back and down
- Chest open
- Head held high
- Arms uncrossed

### Power Poses

**Before stressful situations:**
- Stand tall, hands on hips
- Or arms raised in V
- Hold for 2 minutes
- Can do in private

### Breathing Connection

**Posture enables better breathing:**
- Upright allows deep breaths
- Diaphragmatic breathing calms
- Slouching restricts breath
- Breath affects nervous system
