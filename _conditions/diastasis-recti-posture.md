# Diastasis Recti & Posture

Diastasis recti—the separation of the rectus abdominis ("six-pack") muscles during pregnancy—affects up to two-thirds of women during pregnancy and can persist long after delivery. This separation significantly impacts posture, core function, and daily life.

The good news: with proper understanding and targeted exercises, most women can significantly improve or fully heal their diastasis.

## What Is Diastasis Recti?

### The Anatomy

Your rectus abdominis muscles run vertically down your abdomen, joined at the center by a band of connective tissue called the linea alba. During pregnancy, hormones soften this tissue while the growing uterus pushes outward, causing the muscles to separate.

**Normal separation during pregnancy:** Up to 2 cm is considered physiological
**Diastasis recti diagnosis:** Separation greater than 2-2.5 cm or 2+ finger widths

### How It Happens

1. **Pregnancy hormones** (relaxin) soften connective tissue
2. **Growing uterus** creates outward pressure
3. **Rectus muscles** stretch apart laterally
4. **Linea alba** thins and widens
5. **Abdominal wall** loses structural integrity

### Why It Matters for Posture

Your core is a canister:
- **Top:** Diaphragm
- **Bottom:** Pelvic floor
- **Sides:** Obliques and transverse abdominis
- **Front:** Rectus abdominis

When the front wall is compromised:
- Spinal support decreases
- Other muscles compensate
- Posture suffers
- Back pain often develops

## Self-Assessment

### How to Check for Diastasis

**Position:**
1. Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat
2. Place fingers horizontally just above your navel
3. Lift your head and shoulders slightly (mini crunch)
4. Feel for a gap between the muscles

**What to measure:**
- **Width:** How many fingers fit in the gap
- **Depth:** How deep can you push (soft = weak tissue)
- **Tension:** Does the gap tense when you engage?

### Severity Levels

**Mild:** 1-2 finger widths, tissue feels tense when engaged
**Moderate:** 2-3 finger widths, some tissue tension
**Severe:** 3+ finger widths, soft/domed tissue, minimal tension

### When to Check

- 6+ weeks postpartum (earlier checks aren't meaningful)
- Before starting any core exercise program
- Monthly during rehabilitation
- Before returning to intense exercise

## How Diastasis Affects Posture

### The Compensation Pattern

Without proper core support, your body compensates:

1. **Lower back arches excessively** (to create stability)
2. **Hips tilt forward** (anterior pelvic tilt increases)
3. **Rib cage flares** (losing stacked alignment)
4. **Upper back rounds** (compensating for lower arch)
5. **Breathing changes** (shallow, chest-dominant)

### Common Symptoms

- Lower back pain
- Feeling of weakness in core
- "Mummy tummy" that won't flatten
- Pelvic floor dysfunction
- Hip pain
- Poor posture despite trying to stand straight

### The Diastasis-Posture Cycle

Poor posture → More pressure on weak tissue → Diastasis worsens → Core gets weaker → Posture gets worse

Breaking this cycle requires addressing both the diastasis and the posture simultaneously.

## What to Avoid

### Exercises to Skip (For Now)

**Traditional ab exercises:**
- Crunches and sit-ups
- Planks (until cleared)
- V-sits and boat pose
- Leg raises with poor control
- Bicycle crunches

**High-pressure movements:**
- Heavy lifting without breath management
- Jumping before core is stable
- Running before core can manage impact
- Intense twisting exercises

### Daily Movement Patterns to Avoid

**Getting out of bed:**
- ❌ Sitting straight up from lying down
- ✓ Roll to side, push up with arms

**Lifting:**
- ❌ Holding breath and bearing down
- ✓ Exhale on effort, engage core gently

**Standing from sitting:**
- ❌ Rounding forward and pushing through back
- ✓ Hinge at hips, use legs

### Signs You're Making It Worse

**The "doming" test:** If you see a ridge or dome shape along your midline during any exercise, that movement is too advanced.

Stop and modify if:
- You see doming
- You feel pressure in your pelvic floor
- Your back arches excessively
- You can't control the movement

## Safe Exercises for Healing

### Foundation: Connection Breathing

This is the starting point for all diastasis recovery.

**Position:** Lying on back or seated
**Practice:**
1. Inhale, let belly gently expand
2. Exhale, feel belly gently draw inward (not forced)
3. Notice pelvic floor slightly lifting with exhale
4. Ribs should move laterally, not just up

**Duration:** 5 minutes daily, multiple times per day
**Importance:** This retrains the core canister to work as a unit

### Gentle Core Reconnection

#### Pelvic Floor Connection

1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Inhale, relax pelvic floor
3. Exhale, gently engage pelvic floor (as if stopping urine)
4. Hold for 3-5 seconds
5. Release completely on inhale
6. 10 repetitions, 3 times daily

#### Transverse Abdominis Activation

1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Place fingers just inside hip bones
3. Exhale, gently draw lower belly inward
4. Feel gentle tension under fingers (not bulging)
5. Hold 5-10 seconds while breathing
6. 10 repetitions

#### Dead Bug Progressions

**Level 1 - Arms Only:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent, arms reaching toward ceiling
2. Exhale, lower one arm overhead
3. Keep lower back gently pressed down
4. Return, repeat other side
5. 10 each side

**Level 2 - Legs Only:**
1. Knees in tabletop position
2. Exhale, lower one toe to tap floor
3. Return, repeat other side
4. Keep pelvis completely stable
5. 10 each side

**Level 3 - Opposite Arm/Leg (only when ready):**
1. Lower right arm and left leg simultaneously
2. Keep lower back pressed down
3. No doming allowed
4. Return, repeat other side
5. 10 each side

### Modified Exercises

#### Modified Plank (Wall or Incline)

1. Hands on wall or elevated surface
2. Body in straight line at an angle
3. Hold 20-30 seconds
4. No doming or sagging
5. Progress to lower surface over time

#### Bird-Dog (Gentle)

1. On hands and knees
2. Exhale, extend one arm forward
3. Return, exhale, extend one leg back
4. Progress to opposite arm/leg together
5. Focus on stability, no rotation

#### Glute Bridge (Modified)

1. Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat
2. Exhale, engage pelvic floor
3. Lift hips without arching back excessively
4. Lower with control
5. 10 repetitions

### Posture Exercises

#### Stacked Alignment Practice

1. Stand against wall
2. Small gap at lower back is normal
3. Ribs over pelvis (not flared)
4. Head against wall if possible
5. Hold 1-2 minutes, breathing

#### Seated Posture Reset

1. Sit on edge of chair
2. Feel sit bones
3. Stack ribs over pelvis
4. Gently engage core
5. Shoulders back and down
6. Practice throughout day

## When to Seek Professional Help

### Physical Therapy Referral

See a pelvic floor physical therapist if:
- Gap is larger than 3 finger widths
- No improvement after 3 months of exercises
- Significant back or hip pain
- Pelvic floor symptoms (leaking, pressure)
- Visible hernia or bulging

### What PT Can Offer

- Proper diagnosis and measurement
- Hands-on treatment techniques
- Individualized exercise program
- Biofeedback for activation
- Clear progression guidelines

### Surgical Considerations

Surgery (abdominoplasty with muscle repair) may be considered if:
- Severe separation with functional impairment
- No improvement after extended conservative treatment
- Associated hernia
- Significant quality of life impact

Surgery is typically considered only after:
- Done having children
- At stable weight
- At least 6-12 months of physical therapy
- Clear medical necessity

## Living with Diastasis

### Daily Movement Strategies

**Getting out of bed:**
- Roll to side
- Push up with bottom arm
- Swing legs off bed
- Use arms to push up to sitting

**Lifting children:**
- Exhale as you lift
- Keep object/child close to body
- Use legs, not back
- Avoid twisting while lifting

**Household tasks:**
- Engage core before pushing/pulling
- Squat to pick up items
- Avoid excessive reaching
- Break up heavy tasks

### Clothing Considerations

**Supportive options:**
- High-waisted compression leggings
- Belly bands (for symptom management, not healing)
- Supportive underwear
- Postpartum recovery shorts

**Note:** Compression doesn't replace exercise but can help manage symptoms during activity

### Exercise Modifications Long-Term

Even after healing, consider:
- Warming up with core connection
- Exhaling on effort
- Avoiding excessive intra-abdominal pressure
- Monitoring for doming during new exercises
- Progressive return to high-impact activities

## Posture Integration

### The Core-Posture Connection

Good posture supports diastasis healing:
- Ribs over pelvis reduces pressure
- Neutral spine shares load evenly
- Breathing becomes more effective
- Core can engage properly

Bad posture hinders healing:
- Rib flare increases separation
- Excessive arch loads weak tissue
- Shallow breathing reduces core function
- Core cannot engage properly

### Daily Posture Practice

**Morning check:** Stand in front of mirror, check rib position
**Throughout day:** Align before standing from seated
**During feeding/holding baby:** Stack alignment
**Before exercise:** Connect breath and posture

### Alignment Cues for Daily Life

- Ribs down (not flared)
- Pelvis neutral (not tipped forward)
- Head over shoulders
- Breath into ribs, not just belly
- Gentle core engagement available

## Partner/Support Person Information

### How to Help

- Learn proper exercise techniques to coach
- Remind about posture gently
- Take over lifting tasks when possible
- Support PT appointments
- Be patient with recovery timeline

### What Not to Say

- "Just do some crunches"
- "You should be healed by now"
- "It's just cosmetic"
- "Push through it"

Diastasis is a real medical condition with functional impacts. Recovery takes time and proper technique.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Diastasis recti is common** and most women can improve significantly
2. **Avoid traditional ab exercises** until tissue heals
3. **Start with connection breathing** and gentle activation
4. **Progress slowly**—tissue healing takes time
5. **Posture matters**—good alignment supports healing
6. **Seek professional help** if not improving
7. **Be patient**—full recovery can take months to years
8. **Focus on function** over appearance
