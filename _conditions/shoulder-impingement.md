# Shoulder Impingement Syndrome

Shoulder impingement occurs when the rotator cuff tendons get pinched between the arm bone and the acromion (part of the shoulder blade). Poor posture—especially rounded shoulders—is a major contributing factor that's often overlooked.

## Understanding Shoulder Impingement

### Anatomy

**What gets impinged:**
- Supraspinatus tendon (most common)
- Subacromial bursa
- Other rotator cuff tendons
- Biceps tendon sometimes

### The Mechanism

**What happens:**
- Space under acromion narrows
- Tendons get pinched with arm movement
- Especially with overhead activities
- Causes pain and inflammation
- Can lead to tendon damage

### Why Women Are Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Rounded shoulder posture
- Less upper body strength typically
- Certain occupations
- Carrying patterns (bags, children)
- Bra strap pressure

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Causes Impingement

**Rounded shoulders:**
- Scapula tilts forward
- Acromion moves down
- Space under acromion decreases
- Rotator cuff gets squeezed
- Pain with arm movement

### Upper Crossed Syndrome

**Related pattern:**
- Tight chest pulls shoulders forward
- Weak upper back fails to counteract
- Shoulder blade position changes
- Impingement risk increases

### Forward Head Posture

**Contributes by:**
- Associated with rounded shoulders
- Changes scapular position
- Affects rotator cuff mechanics
- Weakens stabilizing muscles

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Typical presentation:**
- Pain with overhead movements
- Pain reaching behind back
- Pain lying on shoulder at night
- Aching in shoulder/upper arm
- Weakness with lifting

### Pattern Recognition

**Classic signs:**
- Pain 60-120 degrees of arm lift
- "Painful arc" phenomenon
- Relief at rest
- Aggravated by repetitive overhead work
- Worse with poor posture

### Warning Signs

**May indicate tear:**
- Sudden weakness
- Unable to lift arm
- Night pain that doesn't improve
- No response to treatment
- Rapid onset after injury

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Check for:**
- Pain raising arm overhead
- Pain with hand behind back
- Pain sleeping on that side
- Tender front of shoulder
- Pain with pushing motions

### Clinical Tests

**Physical exam may include:**
- Neer test
- Hawkins test
- Empty can test
- Range of motion assessment
- Postural evaluation

### Imaging

**When needed:**
- X-ray for bone spurs
- MRI for soft tissue
- Ultrasound for tendon issues

## Treatment

### Postural Correction (Critical)

**Address first:**
- Correct forward head
- Reverse rounded shoulders
- Improve thoracic mobility
- Strengthen scapular muscles

**Without posture correction, other treatments may fail**

### Chest Stretches

**Doorway stretch:**
1. Arms on door frame at 90°
2. Step through
3. Feel chest stretch
4. Hold 30-60 seconds
5. 3 times daily

**Corner stretch:**
1. Face corner
2. Forearms on walls
3. Lean in
4. Hold 30-60 seconds

### Scapular Exercises

**Scapular squeezes:**
1. Squeeze shoulder blades together
2. Down and back
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. 15 repetitions, 3 sets

**Wall slides:**
1. Back against wall
2. Arms in goalpost position
3. Slide up and down
4. Keep contact with wall
5. 10-15 repetitions

**Prone Y-T-W:**
1. Lie face down
2. Lift arms in Y, T, W
3. Focus on scapular control
4. 10 each position

### Rotator Cuff Strengthening

**External rotation:**
1. Elbow at side, bent 90°
2. Band resistance
3. Rotate out keeping elbow in
4. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Internal rotation:**
1. Same position
2. Rotate inward
3. Control the movement
4. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Side-lying external rotation:**
1. Lie on unaffected side
2. Top arm bent at 90°
3. Rotate arm up
4. Light weight or no weight initially
5. 10-15 reps

### Things to Avoid

**During recovery:**
- Overhead pressing
- Behind-neck exercises
- Upright rows
- Sleeping on affected side
- Carrying heavy bags on that shoulder

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**Typically includes:**
- Manual therapy
- Exercise progression
- Postural retraining
- Activity modification
- Taping sometimes

### Other Interventions

**When needed:**
- Anti-inflammatory medication
- Cortisone injection
- Surgery (for structural issues or failed conservative care)

## Prevention

### Posture Maintenance

- Regular posture checks
- Strengthen upper back
- Stretch chest daily
- Ergonomic workspace
- Balanced exercise programming

### Exercise Balance

- More pulling than pushing
- Don't neglect rotator cuff
- Upper back focus
- Proper form always
- Gradual progression

### Daily Habits

- Vary carrying sides
- Don't carry heavy shoulder bags
- Take movement breaks
- Sleep position awareness
- Watch overhead activities

## Return to Activity

### Progression

**After improvement:**
1. Pain-free range of motion
2. Basic strengthening
3. Sport/activity specific
4. Gradual return
5. Maintenance program

### Ongoing Prevention

- Continue posture work
- Rotator cuff maintenance
- Flexibility routine
- Proper warm-up
- Avoid overuse

## Key Points

1. **Posture is crucial** — Rounded shoulders major factor
2. **Space matters** — Impingement is mechanical
3. **Fix posture first** — Other treatments may fail otherwise
4. **Strengthen back** — Counteracts forward posture
5. **Avoid aggravating** — Modify activities during recovery
6. **Usually responds** — To conservative treatment
