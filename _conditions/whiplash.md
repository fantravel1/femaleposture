# Whiplash

Whiplash is a neck injury caused by rapid back-and-forth movement of the head, commonly from car accidents. Recovery involves restoring proper posture and neck function while managing pain.

## Understanding Whiplash

### What Happens

**The injury:**
- Rapid acceleration/deceleration
- Neck forced beyond normal range
- Soft tissues stretched/torn
- Muscles, ligaments, discs affected
- Nerves may be irritated

### Symptoms

**Common complaints:**
- Neck pain and stiffness
- Headaches (base of skull)
- Shoulder and upper back pain
- Dizziness
- Fatigue

## Recovery and Posture

### Early Phase (First 2 Weeks)

**Focus on:**
- Gentle movement (not immobilization)
- Pain management
- Avoiding aggravating activities
- Ice or heat as helpful
- Support for sleep

### Middle Phase (2-6 Weeks)

**Progress to:**
- Gentle range of motion
- Postural awareness
- Isometric strengthening
- Gradual return to activities

### Later Phase (6+ Weeks)

**Continue with:**
- Full range of motion
- Progressive strengthening
- Normal activities
- Posture restoration

## Exercises for Recovery

### Gentle Range of Motion

**Neck rotations:**
- Slow turns left and right
- Only to comfortable range
- 10 each direction

**Chin tucks:**
- Gentle retraction
- Short holds
- 10 repetitions

### Strengthening (When Ready)

**Isometric exercises:**
- Press head into hand
- Hold 5 seconds
- All directions
- No movement occurs

## Key Points

1. **Early movement helps** — Not prolonged rest
2. **Gradual progression** — Respect healing
3. **Posture matters** — Restore alignment
4. **Most recover well** — Within weeks to months
5. **Seek help if not improving** — Professional guidance
