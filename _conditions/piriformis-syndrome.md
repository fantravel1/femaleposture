# Piriformis Syndrome

Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis muscle in the buttock irritates or compresses the sciatic nerve. It causes deep buttock pain that may radiate down the leg, often mimicking sciatica from a disc problem.

## Understanding Piriformis Syndrome

### Anatomy

**The piriformis muscle:**
- Deep in the buttock
- Runs from sacrum to hip
- Externally rotates the hip
- Sciatic nerve runs near or through it
- About the size of a large thumb

### Why Women Are More Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Wider pelvis creates different angle
- Hormonal influences on muscle
- Running and cycling patterns
- High heel wearing
- More common sitting positions

### The Problem

**What happens:**
- Piriformis becomes tight or spasms
- May swell or thicken
- Compresses or irritates sciatic nerve
- Creates pain and symptoms
- Often from overuse or prolonged sitting

## Causes

### Sitting-Related

**Common contributors:**
- Prolonged sitting
- Wallet in back pocket
- Hard surfaces
- Cross-legged sitting
- Poor posture when seated

### Activity-Related

**From exercise:**
- Running (especially hills)
- Cycling
- Stair climbing
- One-sided activities
- Sudden increase in training

### Postural Issues

**Contributing factors:**
- Muscle imbalances
- Leg length difference
- Pelvic asymmetry
- SI joint dysfunction
- Weak hip abductors

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Typical presentation:**
- Deep aching in buttock
- Pain with sitting
- Pain radiating down leg
- Worse with prolonged sitting
- Relief with walking sometimes

### Distinguishing Features

**Different from disc sciatica:**
- Pain centers in buttock
- May not go below knee
- Tender point in buttock
- Worse with sitting on hard surfaces
- May improve with standing

### Other Symptoms

**May experience:**
- Difficulty sitting comfortably
- Pain climbing stairs
- Discomfort driving
- Hip external rotation pain
- Achiness after sitting

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Check for:**
- Tender spot deep in buttock
- Pain with sitting over 20 minutes
- Relief with piriformis stretch
- Worse sitting on firm surfaces
- Pain with crossing affected leg

### Clinical Tests

**Physical therapy tests:**
- Piriformis stretch test
- FAIR test
- Pace sign
- Tenderness on palpation

### Ruling Out Other Causes

**Important to exclude:**
- Lumbar disc herniation
- Lumbar stenosis
- SI joint dysfunction
- Hip joint problems

## Treatment

### Self-Care

**Initial approach:**
- Avoid prolonged sitting
- Use cushion when seated
- Ice for acute pain
- Gentle stretching
- Modify activities

### Piriformis Stretches

**Supine piriformis stretch:**
1. Lie on back
2. Cross affected ankle over opposite knee
3. Pull bottom knee toward chest
4. Feel stretch deep in buttock
5. Hold 60 seconds, repeat 3 times

**Seated piriformis stretch:**
1. Sit in chair
2. Cross affected leg (ankle on knee)
3. Keep back straight
4. Lean forward gently
5. Hold 30-60 seconds

**Pigeon pose:**
1. From hands and knees
2. Bring affected leg forward, knee out
3. Extend other leg behind
4. Lower body toward floor
5. Hold 60-90 seconds

### Hip Strengthening

**Clamshells:**
1. Lie on side
2. Knees bent, feet together
3. Lift top knee
4. Don't rotate pelvis
5. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Hip abduction:**
1. Side lying or standing
2. Lift leg out to side
3. Keep neutral spine
4. 15 reps, 3 sets each side

**Single leg bridge:**
1. Regular bridge position
2. Extend one leg
3. Drive through heel
4. 10 reps each side

### Self-Massage

**Tennis ball release:**
1. Sit on tennis ball on firm surface
2. Position on tender spot
3. Apply pressure by leaning
4. Hold 30-60 seconds
5. Move to next spot

**Foam roller:**
1. Sit on roller
2. Cross affected leg
3. Lean into affected buttock
4. Roll slowly
5. 1-2 minutes

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Sitting

**Changes to make:**
- Remove wallet from back pocket
- Use cushion on hard seats
- Limit sitting duration
- Regular standing breaks
- Proper chair height

### Driving

**For long drives:**
- Cushion under affected side
- Regular stops
- Stretch at breaks
- Adjust seat position
- Consider seat pad

### Exercise Modifications

**Helpful:**
- Swimming
- Walking
- Elliptical (may need modification)
- Stretching routine

**May aggravate:**
- Running (initially)
- Cycling (initially)
- Heavy squatting
- Lunges with poor form

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Manual therapy
- Dry needling
- Exercise prescription
- Gait analysis
- Postural assessment

### Other Interventions

**When needed:**
- Injection (diagnostic/therapeutic)
- Massage therapy
- Osteopathic manipulation
- Rarely surgery

## Prevention

### Daily Habits

- Limit prolonged sitting
- Regular stretching
- Proper exercise progression
- Balanced hip strengthening
- Good posture

### For Runners/Cyclists

- Proper bike fit
- Gradual mileage increases
- Hip strengthening
- Stretching routine
- Recovery days

## Key Points

1. **Common in women** — Pelvis anatomy contributes
2. **Sitting is key factor** — Especially on hard surfaces
3. **Stretching helps** — Regular piriformis stretches
4. **Strengthen hips** — Weakness contributes
5. **Address sitting habits** — Remove wallet, use cushion
6. **Often responds well** — To conservative treatment
