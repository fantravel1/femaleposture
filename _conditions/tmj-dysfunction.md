# TMJ Dysfunction and Posture

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction affects the jaw joint and surrounding muscles. Posture, particularly forward head position, significantly influences jaw mechanics and is often overlooked as a contributing factor.

## Understanding TMJ Dysfunction

### The TMJ

**Anatomy:**
- Joint connecting jaw to skull
- Located in front of each ear
- Most used joint in the body
- Complex sliding and hinge motion
- Surrounded by muscles

### What Goes Wrong

**TMJ dysfunction includes:**
- Joint pain
- Muscle pain
- Clicking or popping
- Limited opening
- Locking
- Headaches

### Why Women Are More Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- 2-3 times more common in women
- Hormonal influences
- Joint structure differences
- Stress response patterns
- Higher rates of forward head posture

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Affects TMJ

**Forward head posture:**
- Changes jaw resting position
- Increases muscle tension
- Alters bite alignment
- Affects jaw mechanics
- Creates muscle strain

### The Mechanism

**What happens:**
1. Head moves forward
2. To see straight, neck extends
3. Jaw drops open slightly
4. Muscles must work to close
5. Constant tension develops

### Shared Muscles

**Muscles connecting neck and jaw:**
- SCM affects head position
- Suboccipitals influence posture
- Hyoid muscles bridge area
- Tension transfers between regions

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Jaw-related:**
- Pain in jaw joint
- Clicking or popping sounds
- Difficulty chewing
- Jaw locking
- Limited opening

### Head and Neck Symptoms

**Often associated:**
- Headaches (especially temples)
- Neck pain
- Ear pain or fullness
- Facial pain
- Toothaches (non-dental cause)

### Other Symptoms

**May experience:**
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears)
- Dizziness
- Sleep disturbances
- Shoulder tension
- Difficulty concentrating

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Check for:**
- Jaw clicking or popping
- Pain when chewing
- Limited opening
- Tenderness pressing on jaw muscles
- Correlation with posture or stress

### Professional Evaluation

**May include:**
- Dental examination
- TMJ palpation
- Range of motion assessment
- Posture evaluation
- Imaging if needed

## Treatment: Postural Approach

### Correct Forward Head Posture

**Chin tucks:**
1. Pull chin straight back
2. Create double chin
3. Hold 5 seconds
4. 10-15 reps, multiple times daily

**Upper back strengthening:**
- Rows
- Face pulls
- Y-T-W exercises
- Scapular exercises

### Jaw Exercises

**Controlled opening:**
1. Tongue on roof of mouth
2. Open mouth slowly
3. Keep tongue in place
4. Close slowly
5. 10 repetitions

**Lateral jaw stretch:**
1. Open mouth slightly
2. Move jaw slowly to one side
3. Return to center
4. Other side
5. 10 each direction

### Jaw Relaxation

**Resting jaw position:**
- Lips together
- Teeth slightly apart
- Tongue resting on palate
- Check throughout day

**Massage jaw muscles:**
1. Locate masseter (cheek)
2. Gentle circular massage
3. 1-2 minutes each side
4. Several times daily

### Neck Stretches

**For neck-jaw connection:**
- Upper trapezius stretch
- Levator scapulae stretch
- SCM stretch
- General neck mobility

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Daily Habits

**Avoid:**
- Gum chewing
- Hard/chewy foods
- Nail biting
- Pencil chewing
- Sleeping on stomach
- Cradling phone

**Practice:**
- Soft foods during flares
- Small bites
- Awareness of clenching
- Regular jaw relaxation
- Good sleeping position

### Stress Management

**Important because:**
- Stress causes clenching
- Tension in jaw muscles
- Worse during high stress
- Mind-body connection strong

**Strategies:**
- Relaxation techniques
- Stress reduction practices
- Regular exercise
- Adequate sleep
- Boundaries when needed

### Sleep

**For TMJ health:**
- Side or back sleeping
- Proper pillow height
- Avoid stomach sleeping
- Address sleep apnea if present
- Consider night guard

## Professional Treatment

### Dental Interventions

**May include:**
- Night guard/splint
- Bite adjustment
- Dental work if needed
- Specialized TMJ splints

### Physical Therapy

**Focus on:**
- Postural correction
- Manual therapy
- Jaw exercises
- Dry needling
- Patient education

### Other Options

**When needed:**
- Medications
- Injections
- Botox (for muscle spasm)
- Rarely surgery

## Prevention

### Postural Awareness

- Regular posture checks
- Ergonomic workspace
- Screen at eye level
- Take breaks from screen

### Jaw Awareness

- Notice clenching
- Check throughout day
- Relax jaw regularly
- Proper tongue position

### Stress Management

- Regular stress relief
- Exercise routine
- Sleep hygiene
- Work-life balance

## Key Points

1. **Posture affects jaw** — Forward head changes mechanics
2. **Common in women** — Hormonal and structural factors
3. **Address whole system** — Not just jaw
4. **Stress matters** — Clenching is common cause
5. **Daily awareness** — Check jaw tension regularly
6. **Multidisciplinary** — May need dentist and PT
