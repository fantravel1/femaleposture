Bunions cause the big toe to angle toward other toes, affecting push-off during walking and overall posture.

## Understanding Bunions

### What Happens

- Big toe angles inward
- Joint becomes prominent
- Pain with shoes
- Progressive deformity

### Posture Effects

- Altered push-off
- Weight shifted outward
- Gait changes
- Knee and hip compensation

## Causes

### Contributing Factors

**Common causes:**
- Narrow shoes
- High heels
- Genetic predisposition
- Flat feet

### Women's Risk

**Higher prevalence:**
- Footwear choices

- Hormonal factors

## Management

### Conservative Care

**Options:**

### Foot Exercises

**Helpful movements:**
