# Golfer's Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis)

Golfer's elbow causes pain on the inside of the elbow, affecting the flexor tendons. Like tennis elbow, it's often work-related and connected to repetitive activities and poor positioning.

## Understanding Golfer's Elbow

### Location

**Inner elbow:**
- Medial epicondyle
- Where flexor tendons attach
- Pain with gripping and wrist flexion

### Causes

**Common activities:**
- Gripping activities
- Throwing motions
- Golf swing
- Computer work
- Carrying heavy objects

## Treatment

### Similar to Tennis Elbow

**Approach:**
- Modify activities
- Eccentric exercises
- Stretching
- Gradual return

### Key Exercises

**Wrist flexor eccentric:**
- Resist wrist flexion
- Lower slowly
- Progressive resistance

## Prevention

### Ergonomics

- Proper grip techniques
- Whole arm involvement
- Work setup

## Key Points

1. **Inner elbow** — Differs from tennis elbow location
2. **Similar treatment** — Progressive loading
3. **Activity modification** — While healing
4. **Ergonomics help** — Prevention and treatment
