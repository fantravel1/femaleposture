# Ankle Instability

Chronic ankle instability often follows repeated ankle sprains, affecting balance, gait, and posture from the ground up.

## Understanding Ankle Instability

### What Happens

- Ligaments stretched from sprains
- Proprioception decreased
- Repeated giving way
- Affects confidence in movement

### Posture Effects

- Altered gait patterns
- Compensation higher in chain
- Balance affected

## Treatment

### Strengthening

**Ankle exercises:**
- Resistance band work
- Calf raises
- Balance training

### Balance Work

**Progressive:**
- Single-leg stance
- Unstable surfaces
- Eyes closed progression

## Key Points

1. **Often from sprains** — Ligament laxity
2. **Proprioception key** — Balance training
3. **Affects whole chain** — Compensations develop
4. **Strengthening helps** — Can improve stability
