# Cervicogenic Headaches

Cervicogenic headaches originate from the cervical spine (neck) and its structures. Unlike migraines, these headaches are caused by neck problems—making posture a crucial factor in both cause and treatment.

## Understanding Cervicogenic Headaches

### What Makes Them Different

**Characteristics:**
- Start in neck, radiate to head
- Usually one-sided (but can switch)
- Triggered by neck positions
- Associated with neck stiffness
- No aura (unlike migraines)

### Mechanism

**How neck causes head pain:**
- Upper cervical nerves converge with trigeminal nerve
- Neck dysfunction refers pain to head
- C1-C3 vertebrae most often involved
- Muscle trigger points refer pain
- Joint dysfunction contributes

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Typical presentation:**
- Headache starting at base of skull
- Radiates to forehead, temples, or around eye
- Usually one side predominant
- Moderate intensity
- Reduced neck range of motion

### Distinguishing Features

**Different from migraines:**
- No pulsating quality
- No nausea typically
- Aggravated by neck movement
- Associated neck pain
- Responds to neck treatment

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Causes These Headaches

**Forward head posture:**
- Strains upper cervical joints
- Tightens suboccipital muscles
- Compresses C1-C3 area
- Creates muscle tension
- Trigger points develop

## Treatment

### Postural Correction

**Essential elements:**
- Chin tucks
- Upper back strengthening
- Chest stretching
- Ergonomic setup
- Movement breaks

### Neck Exercises

**Suboccipital release:**
- Tennis balls at skull base
- Lie on back
- 2-5 minutes of pressure

**Upper cervical mobility:**
- Gentle nodding motions
- Rotation with chin tucked
- Small, controlled movements

## Key Points

1. **Neck is the source** — Head pain refers from neck
2. **Posture contributes** — Forward head major factor
3. **Treatable** — Responds to neck treatment
4. **Often overlooked** — Misdiagnosed as migraine
5. **Physical therapy helps** — Manual therapy effective
