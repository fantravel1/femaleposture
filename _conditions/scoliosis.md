# Scoliosis in Women

> **Overview:** Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that affects 2-3% of the population. It's significantly more common in females, particularly for curves that require treatment. Understanding your scoliosis helps you manage it effectively.

---

## What Is Scoliosis?

A normal spine is straight when viewed from behind. With scoliosis, the spine curves sideways (and often rotates), creating an S or C shape.

**Characteristics:**
- Sideways curve of 10+ degrees (measured on X-ray)
- Often includes rotation of vertebrae
- May affect one or multiple sections of spine
- More common and often more severe in females

---

## Types of Scoliosis

### Idiopathic Scoliosis (Most Common)

- No known cause (80-85% of cases)
- Often develops during adolescent growth spurts
- More common in girls than boys (8:1 for significant curves)
- May have genetic component

### Degenerative Scoliosis

- Develops in adulthood
- Related to disc and joint degeneration
- Often appears after age 40
- Can worsen with osteoporosis

### Congenital Scoliosis

- Present at birth
- Due to vertebral malformation
- Less common

## Signs to Watch For

**In teens/young adults:**
- One shoulder higher than the other
- One shoulder blade more prominent
- Uneven waist
- One hip higher or more prominent
- Head not centered over pelvis
- Ribs more prominent on one side when bending forward

**In adults:**
- Back pain or stiffness
- Changes in posture
- Difficulty standing straight
- Visible asymmetry

---

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Adam's Forward Bend Test

1. Bend forward at the waist, arms hanging down
2. Have someone look at your back from behind
3. A visible rib hump or asymmetry suggests scoliosis

**Note:** This is a screening tool. Diagnosis requires X-ray measurement.

### When to See a Doctor

- Visible asymmetry in shoulders, hips, or waist
- Back pain that persists
- Changes in posture
- If a teen is still growing and has scoliosis signs

---

## Treatment Options

### Observation

For mild curves (10-25 degrees):
- Regular monitoring
- X-rays at intervals
- Especially important during growth

### Bracing

For moderate curves during growth:
- Worn to prevent progression
- Most effective in growing teens
- Various types available

### Physical Therapy / Exercise

For most scoliosis patients:
- Scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE)
- Schroth method and similar approaches
- Focus on asymmetric strengthening and stretching
- Can reduce pain and improve function

### Surgery

For severe curves (typically 45-50+ degrees):
- Spinal fusion
- Other surgical approaches
- Generally reserved for significant curves

---

## Exercise Considerations

### What Helps

- Scoliosis-specific physical therapy (Schroth, SEAS)
- Core strengthening (with appropriate modifications)
- Swimming and aquatic exercise
- Yoga (with modifications)
- General fitness and strength training

### What to Know

- Standard exercises may need modification
- Asymmetric exercises target the curve
- Work with a provider who understands scoliosis
- Exercise can help pain and function even if curve doesn't change

### Finding Help

Look for:
- Physical therapists trained in scoliosis-specific methods
- Certified Schroth therapists
- Practitioners who understand spinal curves

---

## Living with Scoliosis

### Daily Life

- Most people with scoliosis live normal, active lives
- Mild curves rarely cause significant problems
- Exercise and body awareness help manage symptoms
- Pregnancy is generally safe (consult your doctor)

### Emotional Support

- Scoliosis can affect body image
- Support groups can help
- Many successful athletes have scoliosis
- Treatment has improved significantly
