# Rib Dysfunction

Rib dysfunction causes pain where ribs attach to the spine or sternum, affecting breathing and upper body posture.

## Understanding Rib Issues

### What Happens

- Rib joints become restricted
- Movement affected
- Pain with breathing
- Upper back stiffness

### Posture Connection

- Slouching stresses rib joints
- Deep breathing limited
- Upper back movement affected
- Thoracic stiffness develops

## Symptoms

### Common Presentations

**Typical symptoms:**
- Sharp localized pain
- Worse with breathing
- Pain wrapping around
- Trunk rotation painful

### Triggers

**Often aggravated by:**
- Deep breaths
- Twisting movements
- Coughing or sneezing
- Reaching overhead

## Management

### Movement Approach

**Helpful strategies:**
- Thoracic mobility
- Breathing exercises
- Gentle stretching
- Posture correction

### Breathing Work

**Focus on:**
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Rib cage expansion
- Relaxed breathing pattern
- Avoid breath holding

## Key Points

1. **Posture related** — Slouching contributes
2. **Affects breathing** — Can limit expansion
3. **Mobility helps** — Thoracic movement
4. **Breathing exercises** — Restore normal pattern
