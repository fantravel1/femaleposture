# Rib Dysfunction

Rib dysfunction refers to restricted or abnormal movement of the ribs where they connect to the spine or sternum. Poor posture is a common contributor, and the condition can affect breathing and cause significant discomfort.

## Types of Rib Problems

### Posterior Rib Dysfunction

**At spine connection:**
- Ribs restrict at costovertebral joints
- Pain with breathing
- Often from slouching
- Common in upper back

### Costochondritis

**At sternum connection:**
- Inflammation at cartilage
- Chest pain (can mimic heart)
- Tender to touch
- May have swelling

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Causes Rib Issues

**Slouched posture:**
- Compresses rib cage
- Restricts normal rib movement
- Creates muscle tension
- Limits breathing capacity

### Breathing Effects

**Restricted ribs:**
- Shallow breathing
- Chest tightness
- Fatigue
- Pain with deep breath

## Treatment

### Breathing Exercises

**Diaphragmatic breathing:**
- Expand belly on inhale
- Allow ribs to expand
- Practice regularly

### Mobility Work

**Thoracic rotation:**
- Gentle twisting movements
- Open rib cage
- Improve mobility

### Posture Correction

**Essential:**
- Improve upper back posture
- Open chest
- Regular movement breaks

## Key Points

1. **Posture contributes** — Slouching compresses ribs
2. **Affects breathing** — Restricted movement
3. **Mobility helps** — Thoracic exercises
4. **Usually responds well** — To conservative care
