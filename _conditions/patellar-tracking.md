# Patellar Tracking Issues

Patellar tracking problems occur when the kneecap doesn't move properly in its groove, often related to hip and foot alignment.

## Understanding Patellar Tracking

### What Happens

- Kneecap moves off-center
- Usually tracks laterally
- Causes anterior knee pain
- Grinding or clicking

### Posture Connection

- Hip weakness contributes
- Foot pronation affects
- Knee valgus pattern
- Whole leg alignment matters

## Symptoms

### Common Presentations

**Typical symptoms:**
- Front of knee pain
- Worse with stairs
- Pain after sitting
- Grinding sensation

### Aggravating Activities

**Often worse with:**
- Stair climbing
- Squatting
- Prolonged sitting
- Kneeling

## Causes

### Contributing Factors

**Common factors:**
- Weak hip abductors
- VMO weakness
- Tight IT band
- Foot overpronation

### Women's Risk

**Higher prevalence:**
- Wider pelvis angle
- Muscle strength patterns
- Ligament laxity

## Management

### Strengthening Focus

**Key areas:**
- Hip abductors
- Quadriceps (VMO)
- Glutes
- Core stability

### Flexibility Work

**Address tightness:**
- IT band
- Lateral thigh
- Quads
- Hamstrings

## Key Points

1. **Hip strength key** — Controls knee alignment
2. **More common in women** — Q angle factors
3. **VMO important** — Inner quad muscle
4. **Whole leg approach** — Hip to foot alignment
