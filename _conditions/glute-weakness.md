# Glute Weakness

Weak glutes are extremely common, especially in women who sit frequently. This affects hip stability, pelvic position, and can contribute to pain patterns throughout the body.

## Understanding Glute Weakness

### The Glute Muscles

**Three muscles:**
- Gluteus maximus (power)
- Gluteus medius (stability)
- Gluteus minimus (support)

### Why It Matters

**Glutes function:**
- Hip extension
- Pelvic stability
- Single-leg stance control
- Shock absorption

### "Gluteal Amnesia"

- Sitting inhibits glutes
- Brain stops recruiting them
- Other muscles compensate
- Needs reactivation

## Effects

### Posture Impact

- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Hip drop during walking
- Poor leg alignment
- Lower back compensation

### Pain Patterns

- Lower back pain
- Hip pain
- IT band issues
- Knee pain

## Treatment

### Activation

**Before strengthening:**
- Bridges with focus
- Clamshells
- Mind-muscle connection

### Strengthening

**Progressive:**
- Bridges progression
- Hip thrusts
- Single-leg work
- Functional exercises

## Key Points

1. **Very common** — Especially in sitters
2. **Need reactivation** — Not just strengthening
3. **Affects whole body** — Chain effects
4. **Trainable** — Responds well to exercise
