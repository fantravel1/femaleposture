# Nerve Tension

Adverse neural tension occurs when nerves don't glide freely through surrounding tissues. This can cause symptoms that mimic muscle tightness and is often related to posture.

## Understanding Nerve Tension

### What It Is

- Nerves need to glide with movement
- Adhesions or posture can restrict
- Creates pulling sensation
- Mimics muscle tightness

### Common Patterns

- Sciatic nerve tension
- Median nerve (from neck/shoulder)
- Femoral nerve tension

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Affects Nerves

- Forward head tethers brachial plexus
- Slouching affects spinal nerves
- Positional compression

### Signs It's Neural

- Stretching doesn't help
- Symptoms in nerve distribution
- Worse with combined movements

## Treatment

### Nerve Gliding

**Gentle mobility:**
- Specific nerve glides
- Not stretching—gliding
- Gradual progression

### Posture Correction

**Address root cause:**
- Correct compression
- Open restricted areas

## Key Points

1. **Mimics muscle tightness** — But different
2. **Gliding, not stretching** — Different approach
3. **Posture contributes** — Compression effects
4. **Responds to treatment** — With right approach
