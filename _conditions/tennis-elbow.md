# Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis)

Tennis elbow causes pain on the outside of the elbow, affecting the tendons of the forearm muscles. While named for tennis, it's common in any repetitive gripping or wrist extension activities, including computer work.

## Understanding Tennis Elbow

### What Happens

**The condition:**
- Overload of extensor tendons
- Degeneration at elbow attachment
- Pain with gripping
- Not actually inflammation (despite "-itis")

### Common Causes

**Activities:**
- Repetitive gripping
- Computer mouse use
- Typing with poor posture
- Lifting with poor form
- Racquet sports

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Contributes

**Workspace issues:**
- Poor wrist positioning
- Mouse too far away
- Keyboard position wrong
- Compensating for other issues

### Chain Effects

**Related factors:**
- Shoulder weakness
- Neck problems
- Whole arm position matters

## Treatment

### Rest and Modification

**Initial approach:**
- Avoid aggravating activities
- Modify grip techniques
- Ergonomic corrections

### Strengthening

**Progressive loading:**
- Eccentric wrist exercises
- Gradual progression
- Key to long-term healing

### Stretching

**Forearm stretches:**
- Wrist extensor stretches
- Hold 30 seconds
- Several times daily

## Prevention

### Ergonomics

**Workspace:**
- Mouse close to body
- Wrist neutral
- Proper keyboard height

### Technique

**For activities:**
- Proper grip
- Whole arm involvement
- Not just wrist

## Key Points

1. **Not just tennis** — Many causes
2. **Ergonomics matter** — Workspace setup
3. **Progressive loading** — Key to healing
4. **Takes time** — Weeks to months
5. **Address cause** — Not just symptoms
