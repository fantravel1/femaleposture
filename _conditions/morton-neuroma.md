## Understanding Morton's Neuroma

### What Happens

- Nerve becomes thickened
- Usually between 3rd/4th toes
- Burning or tingling sensation
- Feels like pebble in shoe

### Posture Effects

- Altered weight bearing
- Avoid forefoot pressure
- Changed gait pattern
- May affect balance

## Causes

### Contributing Factors

**Common causes:**
- Narrow shoes
- High heels
- Repetitive stress
- Foot structure

### Women's Risk

**Higher prevalence:**
- Footwear choices
- Tight toe boxes
- High heel wearing

## Management
