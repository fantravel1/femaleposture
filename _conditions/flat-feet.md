# Flat Feet (Pes Planus)

Flat feet occur when the arch of the foot collapses, causing the entire sole to contact the ground. This can affect alignment up the entire kinetic chain from ankle to spine.

## Understanding Flat Feet

### Types

**Flexible flat feet:**
- Arch present when non-weight-bearing
- Collapses with standing
- Most common type

**Rigid flat feet:**
- No arch even when not standing
- May be congenital or from injury

## Effects on Posture

### Kinetic Chain

**How it affects alignment:**
- Ankle rolls inward (pronation)
- Knee rotates inward
- Hip internal rotation
- Can affect pelvis and spine

### Associated Issues

**May contribute to:**
- Plantar fasciitis
- Knee problems
- Hip pain
- Lower back pain

## Treatment

### Exercises

**Arch strengthening:**
- Towel scrunches
- Short foot exercise
- Calf raises

**Hip strengthening:**
- Important because affects control
- Clamshells, abduction work

### Footwear

**Helpful:**
- Motion control shoes
- Arch support
- Avoid flat, unsupportive shoes

### Orthotics

**When helpful:**
- Over-the-counter for mild
- Custom for significant issues
- Should be comfortable

## Key Points

1. **Common** — Many people have flat feet
2. **Affects alignment** — Up the chain
3. **May not cause problems** — Some asymptomatic
4. **Strengthening helps** — Foot and hip
5. **Supportive footwear** — Important for symptoms
