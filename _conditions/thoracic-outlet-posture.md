# Breathing Disorders and Posture

Posture significantly affects breathing capacity and efficiency. Poor posture can contribute to breathing problems, while breathing disorders can affect posture in return.

## The Posture-Breathing Connection

### How Posture Affects Breathing

**Slouched posture:**
- Compresses lungs
- Restricts diaphragm
- Reduces capacity 30%+
- Forces chest breathing

### Common Breathing Issues

**Often posture-related:**
- Shallow breathing
- Chest breathing dominance
- Shortened breath
- Dysfunctional patterns

## Effects

### Physical Impact

**Poor breathing causes:**
- Reduced oxygen
- Increased tension
- Neck and shoulder problems
- Energy reduction

### Anxiety Connection

**Breathing affects:**
- Nervous system activation
- Anxiety symptoms
- Stress response

## Treatment

### Posture Correction

**First step:**
- Improve seated posture
- Open chest
- Allow diaphragm to work

### Breathing Exercises

**Diaphragmatic breathing:**
- Breathe into belly
- Let ribs expand
- Slow, full breaths
- Practice regularly

### Combined Approach

**Both together:**
- Fix posture
- Practice breathing
- Regular exercise
- Stress management

## Key Points

1. **Posture limits breathing** — Compression effect
2. **30% reduction possible** — From slouching
3. **Diaphragm key** — Needs room to work
4. **Practice helps** — Breathing is trainable
5. **Affects whole body** — Energy, stress, function
