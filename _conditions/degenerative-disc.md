# Degenerative Disc Disease

Degenerative disc disease involves age-related disc changes that can affect spinal alignment and movement patterns.

## Understanding Disc Degeneration

### What Happens

- Discs lose hydration
- Height decreases
- Less shock absorption
- Part of normal aging

### Posture Effects

- Spinal curves may change
- Height loss over time
- Stiffness increases
- Movement patterns adapt

## Symptoms

### Variable Presentation

**May cause:**
- Localized back pain
- Stiffness
- Reduced flexibility
- Often asymptomatic

### Location Matters

**Depends on level:**
- Cervical: neck stiffness
- Lumbar: low back pain
- Multiple levels possible

## Management

### Exercise Approach

**Key elements:**
- Core strengthening
- Spinal mobility
- Posture awareness
- Regular movement

### Daily Strategies

**Helpful habits:**
- Frequent position changes
- Proper lifting mechanics
- Supportive sleeping position
- Stay active

## Key Points

1. **Very common** — Part of aging
2. **Often not painful** — Images don't equal pain
3. **Movement helps** — Stay active
4. **Core important** — Support your spine
