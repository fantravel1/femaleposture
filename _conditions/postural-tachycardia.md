# Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

POTS is a condition where heart rate increases excessively upon standing. It predominantly affects women and requires specific considerations for posture, exercise, and daily activities.

## Understanding POTS

### What Happens

**The condition:**
- Heart rate increases 30+ bpm with standing
- Blood pooling in legs
- Symptoms upon standing
- Affects autonomic nervous system

### Why Women Are Affected More

**5:1 female to male ratio:**
- Hormonal influences
- Often onset after illness or pregnancy
- More common in young women

## Symptoms

### When Standing

**Common complaints:**
- Rapid heart rate
- Lightheadedness
- Difficulty thinking
- Fatigue
- Sometimes fainting

## Posture Considerations

### Helpful Strategies
