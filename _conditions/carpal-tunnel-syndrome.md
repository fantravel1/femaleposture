# Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) causes numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand from compression of the median nerve at the wrist. While the wrist is the site of compression, posture—particularly of the neck, shoulder, and arm—often contributes.

## Understanding Carpal Tunnel

### Anatomy

**The carpal tunnel:**
- Narrow passageway in wrist
- Bounded by bones and ligament
- Median nerve passes through
- Nine flexor tendons also pass through
- Limited space for swelling

### What Happens

**In CTS:**
- Contents of tunnel swell
- Pressure on median nerve
- Nerve function affected
- Numbness, tingling, weakness
- Can be progressive

### Why Women Are More Affected

**3 times more common in women:**
- Smaller carpal tunnel
- Hormonal influences
- Pregnancy swelling
- Thyroid conditions more common
- Certain occupations

## The Posture Connection

### Double Crush Syndrome

**Important concept:**
- Nerve irritated at multiple points
- Neck position affects nerve at spine
- Shoulder position affects brachial plexus
- Wrist is final compression site
- All levels matter for treatment

### How Posture Contributes

**Forward head posture:**
- Cervical nerve roots compressed
- Nerve already irritated at neck
- Less tolerance for compression at wrist
- Symptoms appear sooner

**Rounded shoulders:**
- Thoracic outlet narrowed
- Nerve compressed mid-pathway
- Adds to cumulative compression
- Must be addressed for relief

### Work Posture

**Computer use issues:**
- Wrists bent during typing
- Shoulders rounded
- Neck forward
- Arms unsupported
- Hours of sustained position

## Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms

**Classic presentation:**
- Numbness in thumb, index, middle, half of ring finger
- Tingling sensations
- Weakness in hand
- Dropping objects
- Difficulty with fine motor tasks

### Pattern Recognition

**Characteristic features:**
- Worse at night (often wakes from sleep)
- Better with shaking hand
- Worse with sustained gripping
- May radiate up arm
- Often both hands (may be worse in one)

### Night Symptoms

**Why nights are worse:**
- Wrist positions during sleep
- Fluid redistribution when lying
- Less movement to "pump" fluid
- Tendon swelling peaks

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Check for:**
- Numbness in median nerve pattern
- Night symptoms
- Relief with shaking hand
- Weakness in pinch grip
- Phalen's test: flex wrists for 60 seconds

### Clinical Tests

**Physical examination:**
- Phalen's test
- Tinel's sign
- Durkan's compression
- Grip strength testing
- Neck and shoulder assessment

### Nerve Conduction Study

**When needed:**
- Confirms diagnosis
- Rules out other conditions
- Determines severity
- Guides treatment decisions

## Treatment

### Address Posture First

**Critical for success:**
- Correct forward head position
- Open chest and shoulders
- Improve thoracic outlet
- Ergonomic workspace
- May relieve symptoms significantly

### Neck and Shoulder Work

**Chin tucks:**
- 10-15 repetitions
- Multiple times daily
- Addresses cervical component

**Chest stretches:**
- Doorway stretch
- 30-60 seconds
- 3 times daily

**Shoulder blade exercises:**
- Scapular retractions
- 15 reps, 3 sets

### Wrist Interventions

**Wrist splinting:**
- Wear at night
- Keeps wrist neutral
- Reduces compression
- Often helpful within days

**Nerve gliding exercises:**
1. Start with fist
2. Extend fingers straight
3. Extend wrist back
4. Extend thumb
5. Rotate forearm palm up
6. Gentle pressure with other hand
7. 10 repetitions, 3 times daily

### Tendon Gliding

**Full sequence:**
- Straight fingers
- Hook fist
- Full fist
- Tabletop
- Straight fist
- 10 cycles, 3 times daily

### Workplace Modifications

**Ergonomic changes:**
- Wrist neutral when typing
- Keyboard at proper height
- Mouse position close
- Monitor at eye level
- Regular breaks

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Sleep

**To reduce night symptoms:**
- Wear wrist splints
- Avoid sleeping on hands
- Prop arms on pillow
- Loose pajamas

### Daily Activities

**Modifications:**
- Take breaks from repetitive tasks
- Use ergonomic tools
- Avoid sustained gripping
- Shake and stretch hands regularly
- Ice for acute flares

### Exercise

**Helpful:**
- Upper back strengthening
- Chest stretching
- Forearm stretches
- Hand and finger exercises
- Yoga (modified positions)

## Professional Treatment

### Physical/Occupational Therapy

**May include:**
- Manual therapy for neck/shoulder
- Nerve mobilization
- Splint fitting
- Ergonomic assessment
- Exercise progression

### Medical Interventions

**When needed:**
- Cortisone injection
- Anti-inflammatory medication
- Surgery (for severe or failed conservative)

### Surgery

**Considered when:**
- Conservative treatment fails
- Severe nerve damage
- Muscle wasting
- Constant numbness
- Can't perform daily activities

## Prevention

### Workspace Setup

- Proper keyboard height
- Wrist neutral while typing
- Mouse close to body
- Monitor at eye level
- Take regular breaks

### Good Posture

- Correct forward head
- Open shoulders
- Supported arms
- Regular position changes

### Hand Care

- Regular stretching
- Avoid prolonged gripping
- Ergonomic tools
- Wrist positioning awareness

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy

**Common during pregnancy:**
- Fluid retention causes swelling
- Usually resolves after delivery
- Conservative management
- Splinting helpful

### Hormonal Influences

**May contribute:**
- Menopause
- Thyroid conditions
- Oral contraceptives
- Premenstrual swelling

## Key Points

1. **Posture matters** — Not just a wrist problem
2. **Double crush** — Nerve compressed at multiple levels
3. **Address whole arm** — Neck to wrist
4. **Splinting helps** — Especially at night
5. **Ergonomics important** — Workstation setup
6. **Usually treatable** — Conservative measures often work
