# Knee Arthritis

Knee osteoarthritis causes joint stiffness and pain that significantly impacts gait, posture, and daily activities.

## Understanding Knee Arthritis

### What Happens

- Cartilage wears down
- Joint space narrows
- Bone changes occur
- Stiffness and pain

### Posture Effects

- Altered walking pattern
- Knee may bow in or out
- Compensation at hip
- Reduced activity

## Risk Factors

### Contributing Factors

**Common factors:**
- Previous injury
- Excess weight
- Joint alignment
- Genetics

### Women's Risk

**Higher prevalence after 50:**
- Hormonal changes
- Joint structure
- Muscle strength changes

## Management

### Exercise Approach

**Key elements:**
- Low-impact activity
- Quadriceps strengthening
- Hip strengthening
- Range of motion

### Weight Management

**Important because:**
- Reduces joint load
- Decreases inflammation
- Improves function
- Slows progression

## Key Points

1. **Keep moving** — Activity helps joints
2. **Strengthen muscles** — Support the joint
3. **Maintain weight** — Reduces joint stress
4. **Low impact** — Protect while active
