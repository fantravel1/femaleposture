# Trigger Points (Myofascial Pain)

Trigger points are hyperirritable spots in muscle that cause local and referred pain. They're extremely common, often related to poor posture, and can cause pain that seems unrelated to the actual source.

## Understanding Trigger Points

### What They Are

**Characteristics:**
- Taut band in muscle
- Tender to pressure
- Refer pain elsewhere
- Limit range of motion
- Very common

### How They Develop

**Contributing factors:**
- Poor posture
- Muscle overload
- Repetitive movements
- Stress and tension
- Inactivity

## Common Trigger Points and Their Patterns

### Upper Trapezius

**Refers to:**
- Side of neck
- Temple
- Behind eye
- Common headache source

### Suboccipitals

**Refers to:**
- Wrapping around head
- Behind eye
- Forehead
- "Band-like" headache

### Levator Scapulae

**Refers to:**
- Angle of neck
- Shoulder blade
- Neck stiffness

### Gluteus Medius

**Refers to:**
- Low back
- Outer hip
- Buttock

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Creates Trigger Points

**Mechanisms:**
- Sustained muscle contraction
- Muscle overload
- Poor blood flow
- Muscle imbalances

## Self-Treatment

### Pressure Release

**Technique:**
1. Find tender point
2. Apply sustained pressure
3. Hold 30-90 seconds
4. Pressure should decrease pain
5. Repeat several times

### Tools

**Options:**
- Tennis ball
- Lacrosse ball
- Foam roller
- Massage tools
- Self-massage

### Stretching

**After release:**
- Stretch affected muscle
- Gentle, sustained stretch
- 30-60 seconds

## Prevention

### Posture Practices

- Regular position changes
- Ergonomic setup
- Movement breaks
- Strengthening program

### Stress Management

- Relaxation techniques
- Regular exercise
- Adequate sleep
- Stress reduction

## Key Points

1. **Very common** — Almost everyone has some
2. **Posture-related** — Often from static positions
3. **Refer pain** — May seem unrelated to source
4. **Self-treatment possible** — Pressure release works
5. **Address cause** — Fix posture, not just treat points
