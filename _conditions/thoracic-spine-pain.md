# Thoracic Spine Pain

Thoracic spine pain occurs in the upper and mid back region, from below the neck to the bottom of the ribcage. Poor posture is one of the most common causes, making this very relevant for desk workers.

## Understanding Thoracic Pain

### The Region

**Thoracic spine:**
- 12 vertebrae (T1-T12)
- Connects to ribs
- Less mobile than neck/low back
- Important for rotation

### Common Causes

**Why it happens:**
- Prolonged poor posture
- Muscle strain
- Joint dysfunction
- Rib involvement
- Sedentary lifestyle

## The Posture Connection

### How Posture Causes Pain

**Slouched position:**
- Overstretches back muscles
- Creates muscle fatigue
- Joint compression
- Stiffness develops

### Computer Work

**Particularly problematic:**
- Hours of forward posture
- Shoulders rounded
- Upper back curved
- Muscles fatigued

## Symptoms

### Typical Presentation

**Common complaints:**
- Aching between shoulder blades
- Stiffness in upper back
- Pain with breathing sometimes
- Worse with prolonged sitting
- Relief with movement

## Treatment

### Thoracic Mobility

**Foam roller extension:**
- Roller perpendicular to spine
- Arms overhead or crossed
- Extend over roller
- Move through region
- 2-3 minutes

**Thread the needle:**
- On all fours
- Reach one arm under and through
- Rotate upper back
- 10 each side

### Strengthening

**Rows:**
- All variations
- 3 sets of 15

**Prone Y-T-W:**
- Lie face down
- 10 each position

### Stretching

**Chest stretch:**
- Doorway stretch
- 30-60 seconds

**Cat stretch:**
- On all fours
- Round upper back
- 10 reps

### Posture Correction

**Essential:**
- Screen at eye level
- Regular breaks
- Position variety
- Strengthening program

## Prevention

### Ergonomics

- Proper workstation setup
- Supportive chair
- Monitor height correct
- Frequent breaks

### Movement

- Don't stay static
- Regular position changes
- Stretching breaks
- Exercise routine

## Key Points

1. **Posture is common cause** — Especially desk work
2. **Mobility helps** — Thoracic extension
3. **Strengthen upper back** — Counteracts slouching
4. **Ergonomics matter** — Workstation setup
5. **Usually responds well** — To conservative care
