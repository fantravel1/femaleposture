# Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), often called "runner's knee," causes pain around and behind the kneecap. It's very common in women and is closely related to hip strength and overall leg alignment.

## Understanding PFPS

### What Happens

**The mechanism:**
- Kneecap tracks poorly
- Pressure on cartilage underneath
- Pain with knee flexion activities
- Common in active women

### Why Women Are More Affected

**Contributing factors:**
- Wider pelvis (Q-angle)
- Hip weakness common
- Knee valgus (knees inward)
- Hormonal factors

## The Posture-PFPS Connection

### Hip Alignment

**How hips affect knees:**
- Weak glutes allow hip drop
- Femur rotates inward
- Knee collapses inward
- Kneecap tracks poorly

### Foot-Knee Connection

**Bottom-up factors:**
- Flat feet can contribute
- Overpronation
- Affects knee alignment

## Symptoms

### Typical Presentation

**Common complaints:**
- Pain behind or around kneecap
- Worse with stairs (especially down)
- Worse with prolonged sitting
- Pain with squatting
- May have grinding sensation

## Treatment

### Hip Strengthening (Essential)

**Key exercises:**
- Clamshells
- Side-lying abduction
- Single-leg squats (when ready)
- Glute bridges

### Quadriceps Strengthening

**VMO focus:**
- Straight leg raises
- Terminal knee extension
- Quad sets

### Stretching

**May help:**
- Quad stretching
- IT band stretching
- Calf stretching

### Activity Modification

**During recovery:**
- Reduce aggravating activities
- Avoid deep squats temporarily
- Low-impact alternatives

## Prevention

### Strong Hips

- Regular hip strengthening
- Single-leg stability work
- Glute activation

### Proper Footwear

- Supportive shoes
- Consider orthotics if needed

### Training Progression

- Gradual increases
- Adequate recovery

## Key Points

1. **Hip strength is key** — Most important treatment
2. **Very common in women** — Anatomical factors
3. **Alignment matters** — From hip to foot
4. **Usually responds well** — To strengthening program
5. **Prevention possible** — With regular hip work
