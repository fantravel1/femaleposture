# Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction

PTTD involves weakening of the tendon supporting the arch, leading to progressive flat foot and posture changes.

## Understanding PTTD

### What Happens

- Tendon weakens
- Arch support decreases
- Flat foot develops
- Progressive condition

### Posture Effects

- Foot rolls inward
- Knee alignment changes
- Hip compensation
- Whole leg affected

## Stages

### Early Stage

**Characteristics:**
- Pain along tendon
- Swelling present
- Arch still intact
- Single heel raise possible

### Progressive Stage

**Characteristics:**
- Arch collapses
- Heel moves outward
- Single heel raise difficult
- Gait affected

## Risk Factors

### Contributing Factors

**Common factors:**
- Age over 40
- Overweight
- Previous injury
- Flat feet

### Women's Risk

**Higher prevalence:**
- More common in women
- Hormonal factors
- Footwear choices

## Management

### Early Intervention

**Key strategies:**
- Supportive footwear
- Custom orthotics
- Strengthening exercises
- Activity modification

### Exercise Focus

**Strengthen:**
- Posterior tibial muscle
- Arch muscles
- Calf complex
- Hip stabilizers

## Key Points

1. **Progressive condition** — Early intervention key
2. **Orthotics important** — Support the arch
3. **Strengthening helps** — Target specific muscles
4. **Affects whole chain** — Hip to foot approach
