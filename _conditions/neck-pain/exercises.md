## Common Mistakes

### 1. Pushing Through Pain
**Problem:** Exercises shouldn't cause pain
**Solution:** Work within comfortable range

### 2. Moving Too Fast
**Problem:** Fast movements can strain neck
**Solution:** Slow, controlled movement always

### 3. Forcing Range of Motion
**Problem:** Overstretching causes more tension
**Solution:** Gentle stretch sensation, never pain

### 4. Only Stretching
**Problem:** Strength is equally important
**Solution:** Include strengthening exercises

### 5. Inconsistency
**Problem:** Occasional exercise doesn't help
**Solution:** Daily or near-daily practice
