# Sacroiliac Pain

SI joint dysfunction causes pain at the base of the spine and often relates to pelvic alignment and stability issues.

## Understanding SI Pain

### What Happens

- Joint becomes irritated
- Can be too stiff or too loose
- One-sided low back/buttock pain
- Worse with certain positions

### Posture Effects

- Pelvic asymmetry
- Altered walking pattern
- Standing on one leg difficult
- Sitting tolerance reduced

## Treatment

### Stabilization

**Core focus:**
- Deep core activation
- Pelvic floor work
- Glute strengthening
- Avoid aggravating movements

### Alignment Work

**Address asymmetry:**
- Muscle balance
- Leg length check
- Pelvic position
- Footwear review

## Key Points

1. **Common in women** — Hormone effects on ligaments
2. **Pregnancy related** — Often starts postpartum
3. **Stability key** — Core and glute strength
4. **Alignment matters** — Check for asymmetry
