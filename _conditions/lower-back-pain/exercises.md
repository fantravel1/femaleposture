## The McGill Big 3

Spine researcher Dr. Stuart McGill developed these exercises specifically for back health:

### 1. Curl-Up (Modified Crunch)

**Why:** Strengthens rectus abdominis without stressing spine

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, one knee bent, one leg straight
2. Place hands under lower back to maintain natural curve
3. Brace core
4. Lift head and shoulders slightly off ground
5. Hold 8-10 seconds
6. Lower and repeat
7. Do 3-5 reps, work up to 8

**Key:** Don't curl all the way up—just slight lift.

### 2. Side Plank (Side Bridge)

**Why:** Strengthens lateral core muscles (obliques, QL)

**How to:**
1. Lie on side, knees bent 90 degrees (beginner)
2. Prop on forearm, elbow under shoulder
3. Lift hips to create straight line
4. Hold 8-10 seconds
5. Build to 3-5 reps each side

**Progress:** Straighten legs for full side plank.

### 3. Bird-Dog

**Why:** Strengthens back extensors and promotes spinal stability

**How to:**
1. Start on hands and knees
2. Extend right arm forward, left leg back
3. Keep back flat—don't rotate or arch
4. Hold 8-10 seconds
5. Return and switch sides
6. 3-5 reps each side

**Key:** Movement should be slow and controlled.

2. Tuck tailbone under (posterior pelvic tilt)
3. Shift weight forward until stretch in front hip
4. Hold 30-60 seconds
5. Switch sides

### Piriformis Stretch

**Why:** Tight piriformis can contribute to back and hip pain

**How to:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Cross right ankle over left knee

4. Feel stretch in right buttock
5. Hold 30-60 seconds
6. Switch sides

### Knee-to-Chest

6. Switch sides
7. Try both knees together

### Cat-Cow

**How to:**
1. Hands and knees position
2. **Cow:** Drop belly, lift chest and tailbone
3. **Cat:** Round back, tuck tailbone
4. Move slowly between positions
5. 10-15 cycles
