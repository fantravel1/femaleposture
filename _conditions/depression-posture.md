# Depression and Posture

Depression affects posture, and posture affects mood—creating a cycle that can be addressed from the physical side. While not a cure for depression, attention to posture can be a helpful complement to other treatments.

**Common patterns:**
- Collapsed, slouched posture
- Head down
- Shoulders rolled forward

- Low energy for holding upright

### How Posture Affects Depression

**Research findings:**

## Posture Patterns in Depression

### What Often Develops

**Physical manifestations:**

### Why This Matters

**The cycle:**

### Building Up

**As tolerated:**

### Self-Compassion

**Essential element:**
- No criticism for posture
- Gentle awareness
- Small improvements celebrated

## Professional Support
