# Vertigo and Posture

Vertigo (spinning sensation) and dizziness can be related to neck problems and posture, particularly cervicogenic dizziness. Understanding this connection can help with management.

## Types of Dizziness

### True Vertigo

**Spinning sensation:**
- Room appears to spin
- Often inner ear-related
- BPPV common cause
- Distinct episodes

### Cervicogenic Dizziness

**Neck-related:**
- Dizziness with neck movement
- Associated with neck pain
- Posture-related
- Not spinning sensation

## The Neck Connection

### How Neck Affects Balance

**Mechanisms:**
- Proprioceptive input from neck
- Muscle tension affects balance
- Forward head alters input
- May contribute to dizziness

### Cervicogenic Dizziness

**Signs:**
- Dizziness with neck movement
- Neck pain/stiffness
- Improves with neck treatment
- Not true spinning

## Treatment

### For Cervicogenic Dizziness

**Approach:**
- Neck posture correction
- Gentle neck mobility
- Manual therapy
- Exercise progression

### When to Seek Help

**Important:**
- Rule out inner ear causes
- Sudden onset needs evaluation
- With hearing changes
- Severe or worsening

## Key Points

1. **Multiple causes** — Not all neck-related
2. **Cervicogenic exists** — Neck can cause dizziness
3. **Posture may help** — If neck-related
4. **Get evaluated** — Important to determine cause
