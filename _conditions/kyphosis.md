# Kyphosis

Kyphosis is an excessive forward curvature of the thoracic spine, commonly called "hunchback" or "rounded back." While some degree of curvature is normal, excessive kyphosis can cause pain, breathing problems, and significantly affect quality of life. For women, understanding this condition is especially important due to increased risk with age.

## Understanding Kyphosis

### Normal Anatomy

**The thoracic spine:**
- Comprises the 12 middle vertebrae (T1-T12)
- Has a natural forward curve (kyphosis)
- Normal range is 20-45 degrees
- Connects to the ribs

**Pathological kyphosis:**
- Curvature greater than 45-50 degrees
- Can be structural or postural
- Affects function and appearance
- May progress if untreated

### Types of Kyphosis

**Postural kyphosis:**
- The most common type
- Caused by poor postural habits
- Generally flexible and correctable
- No structural changes in vertebrae

**Scheuermann's kyphosis:**
- Appears in adolescence
- Vertebrae develop a wedge shape
- More rigid than postural
- May require more intensive treatment

**Congenital kyphosis:**
- Present from birth
- Vertebral malformation
- May require surgical intervention

**Degenerative/osteoporotic kyphosis:**
- Common in older women
- Compression fractures of vertebrae
- Related to loss of bone density
- Preventable with bone care

## Causes in Women

### Postural Factors

**Modern habits:**
- Desk work
- Mobile device use
- Driving long hours
- Sedentary lifestyle

**Specific factors:**
- Breast size (pulling forward)
- Body shame (hunching)
- Carrying heavy bags
- Breastfeeding positions

### Osteoporosis

**Why women have higher risk:**
- Smaller, less dense bones
- Estrogen loss at menopause
- Less weight-bearing activity
- Longer life expectancy

**How it causes kyphosis:**
- Vertebrae lose density
- They compress gradually
- Wedge shape (shorter at front)
- Multiple affected vertebrae = curve

### Age-Related Changes

**Natural process:**
- Intervertebral discs dehydrate
- Ligaments lose elasticity
- Muscles weaken
- Posture tends to hunch

## Symptoms and Signs

### Physical Symptoms

**Appearance:**
- Visible rounded back
- Shoulders that fall forward
- Head that projects forward
- Possible spine prominence

**Discomforts:**
- Pain in mid or upper back
- Stiffness
- Muscle fatigue
- Difficulty standing upright

### Advanced Symptoms

**In severe cases:**
- Breathing difficulty
- Digestive problems
- Significant height loss
- Activity limitation

## Diagnosis

### Self-Assessment

**Wall test:**
1. Stand with your back against a wall
2. Heels, buttocks, back touching
3. Can you touch your head without arching your lower back?
4. Difficulty suggests kyphosis

**Photo test:**
1. Profile photo in natural position
2. Observe the curve of your back
3. Compare with ideal alignment

### Professional Evaluation

**The doctor may:**
- Perform detailed physical exam
- Take X-rays to measure angle
- Order bone density test if appropriate
- Rule out other conditions

## Exercises for Kyphosis

### Important Precaution

**If you have osteoporosis:**
- Avoid spinal flexion with load
- Avoid excessive rotation
- Consult with physiotherapist first
- Modify traditional exercises

### Extension Exercises

**Prone extension (Modified Superman):**
1. Lie face down
2. Hands under forehead
3. Lift head and shoulders slightly
4. Keep neck in line with spine
5. 10 seconds, 10 repetitions

**Towel extension:**
1. Roll up a towel
2. Place it perpendicular under upper back
3. Lie down with arms open
4. Breathe deeply 2-3 minutes

### Extensor Strengthening

**Band row:**
1. Sit with legs extended
2. Band around feet
3. Pull elbows back
4. Squeeze shoulder blades
5. 15 reps, 3 sets

**Prone Y-T-W:**
1. Face down, forehead on floor
2. Lift arms in Y shape
3. Then in T shape
4. Then in W (elbows bent)
5. 8 of each, 2 sets

### Thoracic Mobility

**Thoracic rotation:**
1. On all fours
2. Hand behind head
3. Rotate elbow down, then up
4. 10 each side

**Foam roller extension:**
1. Roller perpendicular under upper back
2. Hands behind head
3. Extend gently over roller
4. Move to different segments
5. 2 minutes total

### Pectoral Stretching

**In doorway:**
1. Arms in frame, elbows at 90°
2. One foot forward
3. Lean until you feel stretch
4. 30 seconds, 3 repetitions

## Prevention in Women

### Bone Health

**Nutrition:**
- Calcium: 1000-1200 mg/day
- Vitamin D: 800-1000 IU/day
- Adequate protein
- Avoid excess caffeine and alcohol

**Exercise:**
- Weight-bearing activity
- Strength training
- Balance exercises
- Regular activity

### Postural Habits

**Ergonomics:**
- Screen at eye level
- Chair with good support
- Frequent breaks
- Postural awareness

**Movement:**
- Change positions frequently
- Stretch regularly
- Avoid prolonged hunched positions

### During Different Life Stages

**Pregnancy:**
- Maintain back strength
- Avoid hunching with the weight
- Safe extension exercises

**Postpartum:**
- Mind posture while breastfeeding
- Strengthen back gradually
- Don't neglect posture due to fatigue

**Menopause:**
- Regular bone density scans
- Weight-bearing exercise
- Supplementation if needed
- Emphasis on extension

## Professional Treatment

### Physical Therapy

**May include:**
- Complete postural evaluation
- Personalized exercise program
- Manual therapy
- Education on body mechanics

### Braces/Orthotics

**In specific cases:**
- Scheuermann's kyphosis in adolescents
- Recent compression fractures
- Not for typical postural kyphosis

### Surgery

**Rarely necessary except:**
- Severe and progressive deformity
- Neurological compromise
- Intractable pain
- Significant respiratory impairment

## When to Seek Help

### Warning Signs

**Consult if:**
- Curvature that visibly progresses
- Pain that doesn't improve with self-care
- Notable height loss
- Difficulty breathing
- Numbness or weakness

### Professionals

- **General practitioner:** Initial evaluation
- **Physical therapist:** Exercise program
- **Orthopedist:** Complex cases
- **Endocrinologist:** If osteoporosis is present

## Daily Routine

### Morning (5 min)

1. Towel extension: 2 min
2. Prone Y-T-W: 1 set
3. Pectoral stretch: 30 sec each side

### During the Day

- Postural checks every hour
- Micro-extension breaks
- Avoid prolonged hunched positions

### Evening (10 min)

1. Thoracic rotation: 10 each side
2. Foam roller extension: 2 min
3. Band row: 2 sets

## Key Points

1. **Kyphosis has different types**—postural, structural, osteoporotic
2. **Women have higher risk with age**—due to osteoporosis
3. **Postural kyphosis is more correctable**—with exercise and awareness
4. **Extensors are key**—strengthening them is fundamental
5. **Bone health matters**—osteoporosis prevention
6. **With osteoporosis, modify exercises**—avoid loaded flexion
7. **Seek help if it progresses**—early treatment is better
