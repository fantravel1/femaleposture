      <h1>Posture Products Guide</h1>
      <p class="lead">Not all posture products work—and many aren't designed with women's bodies in mind. Our guides cut through the marketing to help you find what actually helps, fits your body, and is worth the investment.</p>

<section class="product-philosophy">
  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>We believe:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Products are tools, not solutions.</strong> No product alone fixes posture—exercise and awareness are essential.</li>
    <li><strong>Fit matters more than features.</strong> The best-reviewed product won't help if it doesn't fit your body.</li>
    <li><strong>Women have different needs.</strong> Height, proportions, and specific concerns require attention.</li>
    <li><strong>Investment should match use.</strong> Spending more makes sense for daily-use items, less for occasional tools.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="buying-principles">
  <h2>Before You Buy</h2>

  <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Does this product fit my specific body size and proportions?</li>
    <li>Will I actually use this, or will it collect dust?</li>
    <li>Does research support this product type, or is it just marketing?</li>
    <li>Can I return it if it doesn't work for me?</li>
    <li>Is this addressing a symptom or a root cause?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Red Flags</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Claims to "fix" posture without exercise or effort</li>
    <li>One-size-fits-all for products where fit matters</li>
    <li>No return policy or very short return window</li>
    <li>Dramatic before/after photos without realistic context</li>
    <li>Discourages seeking professional help for pain</li>
  </ul>

<section class="free-alternatives">
  <h2>Before Buying: Free Alternatives</h2>
  <p>Many posture improvements cost nothing:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Setting posture reminder alarms on your phone</li>
    <li>Building awareness through body scans</li>
    <li>Taking regular movement breaks</li>

  <p>Products can help, but start with free approaches first.</p>
