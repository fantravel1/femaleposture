# Grounding Techniques

Grounding brings you back to the present moment through physical sensation. When anxiety takes you to the future, or memories pull you to the past, grounding anchors you in the now, in your body, in this moment.

## What Is Grounding?

### Physical Presence

**Grounding means:**
- Feeling your body in space
- Connecting to physical sensations
- Anchoring in the present moment
- Using senses to orient
- Returning from mental overwhelm

### When to Ground

**Helpful situations:**
- Anxiety and panic
- Dissociation
- Flashbacks or intrusive memories
- Emotional overwhelm
- Feeling disconnected from body

## Physical Grounding Techniques

- Feel feet touching floor
- Notice the pressure and texture

- Stand or sit with awareness

## Building Grounding Capacity
