## The Complicated Relationship with Body

### Body Awareness Challenges

### Posture Focus Concerns

**Why this is delicate:**

**Be careful with:**

---

## A Different Approach

### If Appropriate

**Only when:**
- In recovery
- Treatment team involved
- Feels safe, not disordered
- Genuinely for wellbeing

### Reframing Posture

**Not about:**
- How you look
- Achieving something
- "Fixing" your body
- Appearance-focused goals

**About:**
- Comfort
- Function
- Reducing pain
- Living in your body

---

## Muscle Weakness and Posture

### Recovery Considerations

**As nutrition improves:**
- Energy returns
- Muscle rebuilding takes time
- Posture capacity improves
- Body heals

### Gentle Rebuilding

**If appropriate:**
- Very gentle movement
- With professional guidance
- Not exercise-focused
- Function-oriented

---

## Body Awareness in Recovery

### Reconnecting Safely

**May involve:**
- Gentle body awareness
- Therapist-guided work
- Slow, titrated exposure
- Trauma-informed approach

### Professional Support

**Consider:**
- Eating disorder therapist

- Occupational therapy

---

## Physical Therapy Considerations

### When It's Appropriate

**May be helpful for:**

- Non-triggering approach
- Coordination with treatment team
- Understanding of complexity

---

## Exercise Considerations

### The Complexity

**Exercise and EDs:**
- Often misused in disorder
- Can be part of recovery
- Requires careful approach
- Professional guidance needed

### Movement in Recovery

**If appropriate and safe:**
- Gentle, not compensatory
- For enjoyment, not burning
- With treatment team approval
- Monitored relationship with exercise

---

## Specific Posture Concerns

### Bone Density

**With osteopenia/osteoporosis:**
- Posture matters for fracture prevention
- Gentle approach
- Medical guidance
- Not about appearance

### Fatigue

**When energy is limited:**
- Supported positions
- Rest when needed
- Function over form
- Gentle with yourself

### Pain

**If experiencing:**
- Address with providers
- Comfort-focused positioning
- Not about "fixing" anything
- Relief-oriented

---

## Self-Compassion

### Your Body Has Been Through a Lot

**Remember:**
- Eating disorders are illness
- Recovery is process
- Body healing takes time
- Kindness required

### Not About "Fixing"

**Posture considerations from:**
- Comfort desire
- Pain reduction
- Function improvement
- Not disorder thinking

---

## For Supporters

### Helping Someone with ED

**Be careful with:**
- Comments about posture
- Appearance-related observations
- "Health" framing that reinforces disorder
- Any body commentary

**Better approach:**
- Support treatment
- Model body neutrality
- Focus on connection
- Let treatment team guide

---

## Recovery-Focused Posture

### Eventually, Maybe

**In stable recovery:**
- Posture may become appropriate focus
- Without disordered motivation
- For genuine comfort/function
- With ongoing self-awareness

### Questions to Ask

**Before engaging with posture:**
- Is this recovery-aligned?
