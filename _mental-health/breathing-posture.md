# Breathing and Posture

> **Breath Is the Bridge:** Your breathing and posture are deeply connected. Poor posture restricts breathing; shallow breathing reinforces poor posture. Improve one, improve the other.

## The Breath-Posture Connection

### How Posture Affects Breathing

**Collapsed posture:**
- Compresses lungs
- Restricts diaphragm
- Forces shallow chest breathing
- Reduces oxygen intake

**Open posture:**
- Lungs can fully expand
- Diaphragm moves freely
- Natural deep breathing
- Better oxygenation

### How Breathing Affects Posture

**Shallow chest breathing:**
- Keeps shoulders elevated
- Creates neck tension
- Locks ribcage
- Reinforces forward posture

**Deep diaphragmatic breathing:**
- Relaxes shoulders
- Releases neck
- Mobilizes ribcage
- Supports spinal alignment

## Understanding Your Breathing

### Check Your Pattern

**Simple test:**
1. Place one hand on chest
2. Place other hand on belly
3. Breathe normally for a minute
4. Which hand moves more?

**Chest dominant:**
- Upper hand moves
- Lower hand still
- Common but not ideal
- Associated with stress

**Belly/diaphragmatic:**
- Lower hand moves
- Upper hand quiet
- More efficient
- Calming effect

### Where Does Your Breath Go?

**Notice:**
- Front, back, or sides of ribcage?
- Just chest or whole torso?
- Shallow or deep?
- Fast or slow?

## Diaphragmatic Breathing

### The Diaphragm

- Dome-shaped muscle below lungs
- Primary breathing muscle
- Descends on inhale, rises on exhale
- Should drive relaxed breathing

### How to Practice

**Position:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent (easiest)
2. Or sit upright with support
3. One hand on chest, one on belly

**Technique:**
1. Inhale through nose
2. Direct breath to belly
3. Feel belly rise, chest quiet
4. Exhale slowly through mouth
5. Feel belly fall
6. Repeat

**Pace:**
- Inhale 4 counts
- Exhale 6 counts
- Longer exhale is calming
- Keep it comfortable

### Practice Progression

**Week 1:**
- 5 minutes daily lying down
- Notice your pattern

**Week 2:**
- 5 minutes sitting
- Same technique

**Week 3:**
- Standing practice
- Throughout day

**Ongoing:**
- Integration into daily life
- Default breathing pattern

## 360 Breathing

### What It Is

Breath that expands the ribcage in all directions—front, sides, and back.

### Why It Matters

- Full lung expansion
- Ribcage mobility
- Spinal support
- Better posture mechanics

### Practice

**Position:**
- Sit or lie down
- Hands on sides of ribcage

**Technique:**
1. Inhale and feel ribs expand sideways
2. Push into your hands
3. Back ribs also expand (feel against floor/chair)
4. Exhale and feel ribs come in
5. Even expansion all around

### Cues That Help

- "Breathe into your back"
- "Widen your ribcage"
- "Fill the sides of your lungs"
- "Umbrella opening in all directions"

## Breath for Stress Release

### Why It Works

- Activates parasympathetic nervous system
- Reduces cortisol
- Releases muscle tension
- Counters stress posture

### Techniques

**4-7-8 Breath:**
- Inhale 4 counts
- Hold 7 counts
- Exhale 8 counts
- Repeat 4 times
- Very calming

**Box Breathing:**
- Inhale 4 counts
- Hold 4 counts
- Exhale 4 counts
- Hold 4 counts
- Repeat
- Centering and focusing

**Physiological Sigh:**
- Double inhale (in-in through nose)
- Long exhale through mouth
- 2-3 times
- Quick stress reset

## Breath and Core

### The Core Canister

**Your core as cylinder:**
- Top: Diaphragm
- Bottom: Pelvic floor
- Sides: Abdominals
- Back: Spinal muscles

### Coordinated Breathing

**On inhale:**
- Diaphragm descends
- Pelvic floor descends slightly
- Belly expands
- Pressure system

**On exhale:**
- Diaphragm rises
- Pelvic floor rises
- Belly draws in
- Core engages naturally

### For Exercise

**Exhale on effort:**
- Natural core engagement
- Supports spine
- Proper timing
- Don't hold breath

## Breath to Improve Posture

### Opening the Chest

**Practice:**
1. Sit tall
2. Inhale, lift sternum
3. Expand ribs
4. Feel chest open
5. Maintain on exhale
6. Repeat, building height

### Releasing Tension

**Practice:**
1. Notice tight areas
2. Breathe into them (imagined)
3. On exhale, release
4. Repeat several times
5. Common areas: shoulders, neck, jaw

### Postural Reset

**Use when you notice poor posture:**
1. Take deep breath
2. As you inhale, lengthen spine
3. Shoulders down and back
4. Exhale, maintain position
5. New posture with breath

## Common Breathing Problems

### Breath Holding

**When it happens:**
- Concentration
- Stress
- Anxiety
- Computer work

**What to do:**
- Notice when holding
- Exhale first
- Resume normal breathing
- Set breath reminders

### Reverse Breathing

**What it looks like:**
- Belly draws in on inhale
- Chest rises excessively
- Common with stress

**Correction:**
- Return to diaphragmatic practice
- Hands as feedback
- Patient retraining

### Rapid Shallow Breathing

**Associated with:**
- Anxiety
- Poor posture
- Stress response

**Addressing it:**
- Slow down deliberately
- Extend exhale
- Practice when calm
- Carry into stressful times
