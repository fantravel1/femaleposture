# Sleep Anxiety and Body Tension

> **The Cruel Irony:** The more you worry about sleep, the tenser your body becomes, and the harder sleep is. Breaking this cycle starts with the body.

---

## The Sleep Anxiety Cycle

### How It Works

**The pattern:**
1. Worrying about sleep
2. Body tenses in response
3. Tension prevents relaxation
4. Can't sleep
5. More anxiety about sleep
6. Repeat

### Where Tension Hides

**Common areas:**
- Jaw clenching
- Shoulder tension
- Breathing shallow
- Stomach tight
- Legs restless
- Overall body bracing

---

## Breaking the Cycle

### Body First

**The approach:**
- Mind follows body
- Release physical tension
- Body relaxation signals brain
- Sleep becomes possible

### You Can't "Think" Yourself to Sleep

**Reality:**
- Trying to sleep fails
- Worrying makes it worse
- Body-based approaches help
- Release, don't force

---

## Pre-Bed Body Practices

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation

**Technique:**
1. Lie down comfortably
2. Tense one muscle group (5 seconds)
3. Release completely
4. Notice the relaxation
5. Move through body

**Order:**
- Feet and calves
- Thighs
- Abdomen
- Chest
- Hands and arms
- Shoulders
- Face

### Body Scan

**Without tensing:**
1. Lie comfortably
2. Notice feet (don't change)
3. Move attention up body
4. Just observe
5. Allow release without forcing

### Gentle Stretching

**Pre-bed stretches:**
- Hip flexors
- Lower back (gentle)
- Neck and shoulders
- Whatever is tight
- Not vigorous, just release

---

## Breathing and Sleep

### Calming Breath

**4-7-8 breathing:**
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 7 counts
- Exhale for 8 counts
- Repeat 4 times

**Why it works:**
- Activates parasympathetic
- Signals safety
- Slows everything down

### If Breath Is Triggering

**Alternative:**
- Focus on exhale only
- Just slow exhalations
- No forced inhale
- Or try body-focused instead

---

## Sleep Position for Anxiety

### Grounded Positions

**May help:**
- Weighted blanket
- Pillow hugging (fetal position)
- Cocoon feeling
- Feeling held

### Back Sleeping for Anxious Bodies

**Can help some:**
- Open body position
- Stomach accessible (breathing)
- But may feel vulnerable
- Try what works

### Side Sleeping

**Common for anxiety:**
- Fetal or modified
- Feels protective
- Pillow to hug
- Knee pillow for alignment

---

## Environment and Body

### Physical Comfort

**Reduce physical triggers:**
- Temperature comfortable
- Darkness adequate
- Noise addressed
- Comfortable mattress/pillows

### Safety Signals

**May help anxious sleep:**
- Door locked (if that matters)
- Nightlight if helpful
- Familiar environment
- Comfort objects okay

---

## Jaw and Face Tension

### The Clenching Problem

**Very common:**
- Jaw clenching
- Teeth grinding (bruxism)
- Facial tension
- Wake with headache or jaw pain

### Release Practices

**Before bed:**
- Open mouth wide, then release
- Gentle jaw massage
- Lips together, teeth apart
- Tongue on roof of mouth, relax

**At night:**
- Mouthguard if grinding
- Check jaw position before sleep
- Conscious release

---

## Shoulder Release

### Carrying Worry

**Common pattern:**
- Shoulders creep up
- Tension held
- Persists into night

### Before Bed

**Release exercises:**
- Shoulder shrugs (tense and release)
- Shoulder rolls
- Arms overhead, stretch and drop
- Conscious dropping throughout evening

---

## The Mind-Body Bridge

- Walking
- Yoga
- Any movement that uses body

**Evening:**
