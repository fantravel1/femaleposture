# PTSD and Posture

Trauma reshapes the body. Long after the traumatic event, the nervous system remains on alert, creating protective postures, hypervigilance patterns, and a body that feels unsafe. Understanding trauma's physical footprint opens pathways to healing.

## How Trauma Affects the Body

### The Stuck Fight-Flight Response

**Trauma keeps the body activated:**
- Chronic hypervigilance
- Exaggerated startle response
- Difficulty relaxing muscles
- Persistent tension patterns
- Sleep disruption and fatigue

### Physical Trauma Patterns

**Common presentations:**
- Protective, collapsed posture
- Hyper-erect, vigilant stance
- Frozen, disconnected body
- Chronic pain without clear cause
- Dissociation from physical sensation

## PTSD Posture Patterns

### Hypervigilance Posture

**The alert body:**
- Elevated shoulders
- Forward head position
- Tense, ready muscles
- Scanning environment
- Quick, shallow breathing

### Collapse and Protection

**The defended body:**
- Curved, protective spine
- Arms guarding torso
- Chin tucked
- Making self smaller
- Withdrawn from space

### Dissociation Patterns

**The disconnected body:**
- Lack of body awareness
- Numb or frozen sensation
- Difficulty feeling physical boundaries
- Clumsy or uncoordinated
- Absence from physical experience

## Body-Based Healing

### Restoring Safety in the Body

**Gradual approaches:**
- Building interoception slowly
- Titrated body awareness
- Resources before processing
- Pendulation between comfort and challenge
- Pacing determined by individual capacity

### Grounding Techniques

**Present-moment anchoring:**
- Feeling feet on floor
- Sensing contact with chair
- Noticing breath without changing
- Orienting to safe environment
- Using sensory input

## Movement and Trauma

### Appropriate Physical Activity

**Trauma-informed movement:**
- Gentle, choice-based approaches
- Yoga adapted for trauma
- Walking in nature
- Swimming or water movement
- Dance and expressive movement

### Cautions

**What to avoid:**
- Forcing body awareness too quickly
- Intense exercise without support
- Triggering positions or movements
- Pushing past dissociation
- Ignoring body signals

## Building Body Trust

### Long-Term Healing

**Restoring relationship with body:**
- Patience with healing timeline
- Professional trauma-informed support
- Small, consistent practices
- Celebrating body resilience
- Compassion for protective patterns

Trauma healing is possible. With appropriate support, the body can learn that danger has passed and gradually release its protective patterns. Professional trauma-informed care is essential for this work.
