# Trauma and Posture

"The body keeps the score." This phrase from trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk captures a profound truth: traumatic experiences don't just affect the mind—they live in the body. Posture is one way the body holds trauma, developing protective patterns that persist long after danger has passed. Understanding this connection is essential for women whose posture is linked to difficult experiences.

## How Trauma Affects the Body

### The Trauma Response

**During trauma, the body:**
- Activates fight, flight, or freeze
- Prepares muscles for action or stillness
- Breathing changes
- Posture shifts for protection
- This is adaptive and survival-focused

**After trauma:**
- Body may stay in defensive state
- Patterns can become habitual
- Chronic tension develops
- Posture reflects the held experience

### Types of Trauma Patterns

**Fight response posture:**
- Tension, particularly in arms/hands
- Jaw clenching
- Aggressive forward posture
- Braced, ready for conflict

**Flight response posture:**
- Elevated shoulders
- Forward lean
- Tight hip flexors (ready to run)
- Restless, unsettled stance

**Freeze response posture:**
- Collapsed, immobile
- Dissociated appearance
- Held breath
- Rigidity or complete slackness

**Fawn response posture:**
- Making self small
- Appeasing body language
- Collapsed but attentive
- Hypervigilant

### Chronic Patterns

**When trauma is ongoing or repeated:**
- Patterns become structural
- Fascia adapts
- Muscles chronically shortened or lengthened
- Nervous system stays dysregulated
- Posture becomes "frozen" in protection

## Common Trauma-Related Postural Patterns

### Protective Curling

**What it looks like:**
- Rounded shoulders
- Arms close to body
- Curled forward
- Protected vital organs

**Underlying function:**
- Makes vulnerable areas less accessible
- Creates physical barrier
- Minimizes exposure

### Hypervigilant Posture

**What it looks like:**
- Head forward (scanning)
- Elevated shoulders
- Tense overall
- Quick, small movements

**Underlying function:**
- Ready to detect threat
- Prepared for action
- Never fully relaxed

### Collapsed/Dissociated

**What it looks like:**
- Very poor muscle tone
- Disconnected appearance
- Slumped without awareness
- Not fully inhabiting body

**Underlying function:**
- When fight/flight wasn't possible
- Leaving body to survive
- Numbing strategy

### Armored Posture

**What it looks like:**
- Rigid, held tension
- Braced throughout
- Limited flexibility
- Hard, protected presentation

**Underlying function:**
- Nothing gets in
- Protection through hardness
- Controlled containment

## Women and Trauma

### Common Trauma Types

**Women experience higher rates of:**
- Sexual assault and harassment
- Intimate partner violence
- Childhood sexual abuse
- Medical trauma
- Relational trauma

**These often affect:**
- Pelvis and lower body
- Chest and breathing
- Overall feeling of safety in body
- Relationship with femininity

### Sexual Trauma and Posture

**May affect:**
- Pelvic holding patterns
- Disconnection from lower body
- Chest protection
- Difficulty with vulnerability
- Bracing against intrusion

### Birth Trauma

**Can create:**
- Pelvic tension patterns
- Dissociation from lower body
- Fear-based holding
- Difficulty relaxing for care

### Medical Trauma

**Results in:**
- Bracing in medical settings
- Generalized body distrust
- Hypervigilance about symptoms
- Protective postures during care

## Trauma-Informed Approach to Posture

### Key Principles

**Safety first:**
- Physical and emotional safety priority
- No forcing through resistance
- Respecting boundaries
- Creating predictable environment

**Choice and control:**
- Client controls pace
- Options rather than demands
- "You can stop anytime"
- Empowerment focus

**Titration:**
- Small doses of change
- Building capacity gradually
- Not overwhelming system
- Respecting window of tolerance

**Collaboration:**
- Working together
- No expert-over-client dynamic
- Respecting client's knowledge of their body
- Shared decision-making

### What's Different from Regular Posture Work

**Trauma-informed work:**
- Slower pace
- More checking in
- Awareness of triggers
- Integration of emotion
- Nervous system focus
- Patience with process

**Regular posture work may:**
- Move too fast
- Not account for emotional response
- Miss underlying patterns
- Trigger without support
- Focus only on physical

## Working with Trauma and Posture

### Starting Points

**Grounding:**
- Feel feet on floor
- Notice the chair supporting you
- Sense the boundary of skin
- Come into present moment

**Resourcing:**
- Find what feels okay in body
- Notice areas without pain
- Build from places of ease
- Strengthen positive sensations

**Pendulation:**
- Move between difficult and okay
- Don't stay in activation
- Return to resource
- Build capacity gradually

### What Might Come Up

**During posture work:**
- Emotions arising
- Memories surfacing
- Body shaking or releasing
- Strong sensations
- Unexpected tears

**This is normal** but needs proper support.

### When to Stop

**Pause if:**
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Dissociating (leaving body)
- Panic arising
- Strong urge to flee
- Feeling unsafe

**Then:**
- Ground (feet, breath)
- Orient (look around room)
- Resource (find something comfortable)
- Get support if needed

## Self-Help Approaches

### Safe Practices

**Gentle movements:**
- Slow, controlled
- Within comfortable range
- Stopping when needed
- Noticing body responses

**Grounding exercises:**
- 5-4-3-2-1 senses
- Feet on ground
- Holding something
- Orienting to environment

**Breathing:**
- Gentle, not forced
- Extending exhale slightly
- Noticing breath without changing
- Allowing natural rhythm

### Practices to Approach with Care

**May need professional support:**
- Deep stretching (may release emotion)
- Chest opening (vulnerable)
- Hip opening (stored trauma common)
- Intensive body work

**Not that these are bad** but may need appropriate container.

### Building Safety in Body

**Gradual process:**
1. Notice body exists
2. Find neutral or okay places
3. Build tolerance for sensation
4. Expand comfortable range
5. Eventually reclaim body

**Takes time.** Be patient.
