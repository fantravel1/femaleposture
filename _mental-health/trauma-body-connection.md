# Trauma and the Body

> **The Body Remembers:** Trauma isn't just psychological—it lives in the body. Understanding this connection is the first step toward healing.

---

## How Trauma Affects the Body

### The Survival Response

**Fight, flight, freeze:**
- Body responds to threat
- Muscle patterns develop
- Nervous system changes
- May persist after threat is gone

### Physical Manifestations

**Common patterns:**
- Chronic muscle tension
- Protective postures
- Startle responses
- Breathing changes
- Pain conditions

---

## Trauma-Related Posture Patterns

### Protective Postures

**May include:**
- Shoulders forward (protecting heart/chest)
- Collapsed chest (making smaller)
- Tight hip flexors (ready to run)
- Clenched jaw
- Hunched shoulders (protecting neck)

### Hypervigilance

**In the body:**
- Constant tension
- Difficulty relaxing
- Alert posture
- Muscle bracing

### Dissociation

**Physical experience:**
- Disconnection from body
- Not feeling sensations
- Poor body awareness
- Posture neglected

## Approaching Body Work Gently

### Trauma-Sensitive Considerations

**Important:**
- Body awareness can be triggering
- Go slowly
- Choice and control matter
- Professional support may be needed

### Not About "Fixing"

**Reframe:**
- Body protected you
- These patterns had purpose
- Healing takes time
- Not about perfect posture

---

## Safe Body Awareness

### Grounding First

**Before body work:**
- Feel feet on ground
- Notice points of contact
- Breath awareness (if safe)
- Stay present

### Titrated Approach

**Small doses:**
- Brief body check-ins
- Not overwhelming sensation
- Stay within window of tolerance
- Build gradually

### Choice and Control

**Always:**
- You decide pace
- Can stop anytime
- Your body, your boundaries
- No pushing through

---

## Professional Support

## Self-Help Considerations

### What May Help

### What to Avoid

**Without support:**

## Gentle Movement Options

### If Movement Feels Safe

**Consider:**

- Dance/free movement
- Whatever feels good

### Approaching Exercise

**Trauma-informed:**
- Choice over obligation
- Modifying is okay
- Eyes open if needed
- Safe environment
- No hands-on adjustments without permission

---

## Breathing Considerations

### Breath Can Be Triggering

**For some survivors:**
- Breath focus is activating
- Deep breathing isn't safe
- Need different approach

### Alternative Approaches

**Instead of breath focus:**
- Feet on ground
- Hands on surface
- Look around room
- Touch something safe

### When Breath Is Okay

**If tolerable:**
- Natural breath observation
- Not changing breath
- Exhale focus may be calming
- Always optional

## Working with Tension

### Understanding the Tension
