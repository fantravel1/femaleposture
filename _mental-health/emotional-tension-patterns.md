# Emotional Tension Patterns

> **The Body Keeps the Score:** Emotions don't just happen in your mind. They create physical responses—tension patterns that become habitual. Understanding your patterns is the first step to releasing them.

---

## How Emotions Become Tension

### The Mechanism

**When you experience emotion:**
1. Brain signals body to respond
2. Muscles contract (fight/flight/freeze)
3. If emotion passes, muscles release
4. If emotion persists or is suppressed, tension remains

**Over time:**
- Patterns become habitual
- Muscles stay partially contracted
- Becomes your "normal"
- Creates postural changes

### Common Pattern

Stress → Tension → Poor Posture → More Stress → More Tension
