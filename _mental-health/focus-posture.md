# Focus and Posture

Your body position directly affects your ability to concentrate. Slumped posture compresses lungs, reduces oxygen, and signals low energy to the brain. Alert, upright posture supports sustained attention and mental clarity.

## How Posture Affects Focus

### The Oxygen Connection

**Breathing and brain:**
- Collapsed posture restricts breathing
- Less oxygen reaches the brain
- Reduced oxygen impairs concentration
- Upright posture allows full breathing
- Better oxygen supports better thinking

### Alertness Signals

**Body-brain communication:**
- Slumped posture signals tiredness
- Brain receives "rest" message
- Alert posture signals readiness
- Brain responds with focus chemicals
- Position affects mental state

## Optimal Focus Posture

### Seated Focus Position

**For desk work:**
- Sitting bones grounded
- Spine naturally upright
- Shoulders relaxed back
- Head balanced over spine
- Feet flat on floor

### Standing Focus

**For standing work:**
- Weight evenly distributed
- Slight core engagement
- Chest open, shoulders back
- Head in neutral position
- Soft knees, not locked

## Supporting Sustained Focus

### Movement for Focus

**Breaking stagnation:**
- Regular position changes
- Brief stretching breaks
- Walking between tasks
- Eye movement and focus shifts
- Physical reset moments

### Energy Management

**Sustaining attention:**
- Recognizing focus fatigue signs
- Taking breaks before depletion
- Movement to refresh
- Breathing to re-energize
- Posture check and reset

## Focus-Enhancing Practices

### Pre-Focus Preparation

**Getting ready:**
- Brief movement to wake body
- Deep breaths for oxygen
- Set upright posture
- Clear physical space
- Minimize discomfort sources

### During Focus Work

**Maintaining attention:**
- Regular posture checks
- Micro-movement integration
- Breathing awareness
- Comfort maintenance
- Fatigue monitoring

### Recovery Between Sessions

**Restoring capacity:**
- Active recovery movement
- Eye rest and distance focus
- Complete posture change
- Stress discharge
- Energy rebuilding

## Common Focus Saboteurs

### What Undermines Concentration

**Physical barriers:**
- Slouching and compression
- Physical discomfort
- Fatigue and depletion
- Tension and stress
- Poor breathing patterns

Your body is an ally for focus when properly positioned and cared for. Small adjustments to posture and regular movement breaks can significantly improve your ability to concentrate.
