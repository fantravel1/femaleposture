# Mindfulness and Posture

> **Awareness Is the First Step:** You can't change what you don't notice. Mindfulness practices build the body awareness that makes posture improvement possible—and sustainable.

## Breath Awareness

### Breath and Posture Connection

**Collapsed posture:**

- Shallow breaths
- Less oxygen

**Open posture:**
- Full breathing possible
- Deeper breaths
- Better energy

### Breath as Posture Tool

**Practice:**
1. Notice your current breathing
2. Is it shallow or deep?
3. Where does breath go? Chest? Belly?
4. Take one deep breath
5. Notice what your body does
6. Often naturally opens posture

### Using Breath for Awareness

- Breath is always present
- Anchor for attention
- Changes with body position
- Feedback loop

2. Notice each step
3. Feel weight shift

### Daily Tasks

## Developing Interoception

### What It Is

### Building Interoception

**Practices:**
- Regular body scans
- Noticing hunger/fullness
- Temperature awareness
- Emotional body sensations
- Exercise with attention

## Mindfulness vs. Hypervigilance

### The Difference

**Healthy awareness:**

- Non-judgmental
- Adjusting without drama
- Background awareness

**Hypervigilance:**
- Constant anxious monitoring
- Harsh self-criticism
- Tension from watching
- Counterproductive

### Finding Balance

- Check in, don't obsess
- Notice and adjust, move on
- Curiosity over judgment
- Trust building awareness will help

## Building the Habit

### Start Small

**Week 1:**

- Few posture check-ins

**Week 2:**
- Add breath awareness
- More frequent check-ins

**Week 3-4:**

**Ongoing:**
- Integration into daily life
- Reminders as needed
- Continuous refinement

### Triggers and Reminders

**Link to existing habits:**

## Common Challenges

### "I Keep Forgetting"

### "I Feel More Pain Now"

- You were always in this position
- Awareness makes it conscious
- This is actually progress
- Now you can change

---

## Integration
