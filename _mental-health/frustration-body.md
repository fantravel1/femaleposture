# Frustration and the Body

Frustration is blocked energy—the feeling of pushing against an immovable obstacle. Your body holds this blocked force as tension, restlessness, and agitation. Understanding frustration's physical nature opens pathways to release.

## Physical Experience of Frustration

- Blocked energy flow

## Working with Frustration Physically

### Immediate Release

- Move the energy

### Physical Outlets

## Transforming Frustration

### Energy Redirect

**Using the energy:**

### Learning from Frustration

**Body wisdom:**
- What is blocked?
- What needs to change?

Frustration's energy isn't bad—it's just stuck. Learning to move and direct this energy transforms frustration from suffering into useful information and motivation.
