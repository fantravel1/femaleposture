# Centering and Posture

Centering is the practice of coming home to yourself physically—finding your core, your stability, your grounded presence. When life pulls you in many directions, centering returns you to your own axis.

## What Is Physical Centering?

### Finding Your Center

**Physical centering means:**
- Awareness of your body's core
- Weight distributed evenly
- Connected to ground below
- Breathing from center
- Present in your body

### When to Center

**Helpful situations:**
- Before challenging situations
- When feeling scattered
- After emotional upset
- During stress
- For decision-making clarity

## Centering Practices

### Standing Centering

**Basic practice:**
- Stand with feet hip-width apart
- Feel weight equally distributed
- Sense your physical center
- Breathe into belly
- Relax shoulders, lengthen spine

### Seated Centering

**In a chair:**
- Sit with both feet on floor
- Feel sitting bones on seat
- Stack spine upright
- Breathe into core
- Soften face and jaw

### Movement Centering

**Dynamic centering:**
- Move from center of body
- Let limbs follow core
- Stay connected to ground
- Maintain breath awareness
- Flow with stability

## Deepening Center Connection

### Core Awareness

**Developing felt sense:**
- Place hand on belly
- Breathe into hand
- Sense internal space
- Feel core as home
- Return attention here

### Expansion from Center

**Radiating outward:**
- Feel center first
- Extend awareness outward
- Stay connected to core
- Move from this place
- Speak from center

## Centering in Daily Life

### Morning Centering

**Starting centered:**
- Brief centering before rising
- Establish connection to core
- Set centered intention
- Carry awareness forward
- Return when lost

### Throughout Day

**Maintaining center:**
- Regular check-ins
- Brief centering pauses
- Returning when scattered
- Centering before transitions
- Evening reflection

## Centering in Challenges

### When Pulled Off Center

**Recovery practice:**
- Notice you've lost center
- Pause without judgment
- Ground through feet
- Breathe into core
- Reestablish center

Centering becomes more accessible with practice. What initially requires effort becomes natural as your body learns to return to its core.
