# Panic Attacks and Body

Panic attacks are intensely physical experiences. The racing heart, shortness of breath, trembling, and overwhelming sense of physical danger—these symptoms convince your body you're in mortal peril. Understanding panic's physical nature offers pathways to management.

## The Physical Reality of Panic

### What Happens in Your Body

**During a panic attack:**
- Adrenaline floods your system
- Heart rate accelerates dramatically
- Breathing becomes rapid and shallow
- Blood flows to major muscles
- Non-essential systems shut down

### Physical Symptoms

**Common panic sensations:**
- Chest tightness or pain
- Difficulty breathing
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Tingling in extremities
- Nausea or stomach distress
- Hot flashes or chills
- Trembling or shaking

## Body Posture During Panic

### Instinctive Responses

**Panic postures:**
- Curling inward for protection
- Bracing and rigidity
- Frozen in place
- Restless pacing
- Clutching at chest or throat

### Breathing Patterns

**Panic breathing:**
- Rapid, shallow breaths
- Breathing from upper chest
- Hyperventilation
- Breath holding
- Gasping sensations

## Physical Management Techniques

### Grounding in the Body

**During panic:**
- Plant feet firmly on ground
- Press palms against solid surface
- Feel weight in chair or on floor
- Notice physical sensations without fighting
- Use the 5-4-3-2-1 sensory technique

### Breathing Restoration

**Calming the breath:**
- Slow exhale longer than inhale
- Breathe into belly, not chest
- Count breaths (in 4, out 6)
- Place hand on belly to feel breath
- Box breathing when possible

## Posture for Panic Prevention

### Daily Practices

**Reducing baseline activation:**
- Regular diaphragmatic breathing practice
- Relaxed, upright posture habit
- Tension awareness and release
- Physical exercise for anxiety
- Stretching and movement breaks

### Pre-Panic Intervention

**Noticing early signs:**
- Body scanning for tension
- Recognizing warning patterns
- Intervening before peak
- Using tools proactively
- Building body trust

## After a Panic Attack

### Physical Recovery

**Post-attack care:**
- Gentle movement to discharge adrenaline
- Continued slow breathing
- Self-compassion for body experience
- Rest without collapse
- Gradual return to activity

Understanding panic as a physical experience—your body's well-meaning but misfiring alarm system—helps reduce the fear of fear itself. Your body can learn new responses with practice and patience.
