# Self-Esteem and Posture: Taking Up Your Space

> **You Deserve to Stand Tall:** How you feel about yourself shows in how you carry your body. And here's the beautiful part—changing your posture can actually change how you feel.

## Key Takeaways

- Self-esteem and posture influence each other bidirectionally
- Low self-esteem often manifests in "small" posture
- Intentional upright posture can boost confidence
- The goal isn't "perfect" posture—it's authentic presence
- You deserve to take up space in the world

## The Mind-Body Connection

### How Self-Esteem Shows in Posture

Low self-esteem often creates:
- Hunched shoulders (making yourself smaller)
- Downward gaze
- Collapsed chest
- Taking up minimal space
- Hiding or protective positions

High self-esteem often shows as:
- Open, upright posture
- Eyes forward
- Chest open
- Taking up appropriate space
- Relaxed but present

### It's a Two-Way Street

**Mind → Body:**
- Feeling unworthy → making yourself small
- Shame → hiding
- Anxiety → protective posture

**Body → Mind:**
- Upright posture → increased confidence
- Open chest → improved mood
- Taking up space → feeling more powerful

## Research: Posture Affects Feelings

### The Science

Studies show that posture affects:
- Hormone levels (testosterone up, cortisol down with expansive posture)
- Subjective feelings of power
- Risk tolerance
- Mood
- Self-perception

### "Power Posing"

While the original "power pose" research has been debated:
- The basic finding holds: posture affects how we feel
- Expansive postures tend to feel better
- Contracted postures tend to feel worse
- Effect sizes vary

### Practical Takeaway

You don't need to strike power poses. Simply:
- Stand and sit more upright
- Allow yourself to take up space
- Open rather than close your body
- Be present in your physicality

## Breaking the "Small" Pattern

### Why We Make Ourselves Small

Common reasons:
- Learned behavior from childhood
- Response to being shamed
- Cultural messages (especially for women)
- Trauma responses
- Low self-worth

### Recognizing the Pattern

Ask yourself:
- Do I slouch when I feel uncertain?
- Do I avoid eye contact when uncomfortable?
- Do I cross my arms protectively?
- Do I take up as little space as possible?
- Do I apologize for my physical presence?

### Beginning to Change

The first step is awareness. Notice:
- When you collapse your posture
- What triggers it
- How it feels in your body
- That you have a choice

## Practices for Building Both

- Take full breaths

**Before challenging situations:**

- Breathe deeply
- Enter feeling grounded

### Mental Practices

**Self-talk:**
- "I deserve to take up space"
- "My presence matters"
- "I belong here"
- Challenge negative self-talk

**Visualization:**
- See yourself standing tall
- Imagine feeling confident
- Picture yourself taking up space
- Use all senses

### Combining Both

The most powerful approach combines:
- Physical posture change

## For Women Specifically

### Cultural Messages

Women often receive messages to:
- Be small
- Not take up space
- Diminish themselves
- Apologize for presence
- Prioritize others' comfort

### Reclaiming Space

Counter these by:
- Deliberately taking up space
- Not apologizing for existing
- Standing tall
- Speaking up (voice is part of presence)
- Claiming your right to be here

### Body Image Intersection

Posture can be complicated by:
- Negative body image
- Hiding parts of body
- Self-consciousness
- Societal pressure

Address both posture and body image for best results.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can changing my posture really change how I feel?

Yes, research and experience both support this. It's not magic, but it's real. Posture is one tool among many.

### I've felt small my whole life—can I change?

Yes. Patterns can change at any point. It takes time and often support, but change is possible.

### Is this about "faking it till you make it"?

Partly. It's about giving your body experiences that your mind can follow. Over time, it becomes more authentic.

### What if I don't want to take up more space?

That's valid. The goal is authenticity, not performance. Explore what feels right for you, perhaps with professional support.
