# Social Anxiety and Posture

> **The Urge to Disappear:** When social anxiety hits, your body wants to shrink—become smaller, invisible, take up less space. This protective instinct creates postures that may actually increase anxiety.

---

## How Social Anxiety Shows in the Body

### The Shrinking Response

**What happens:**
- Shoulders round forward
- Arms cross or hold self
- Head drops
- Chest collapses
- Body closes in

**Why:**
- Protecting vulnerable areas
- Becoming smaller, less visible
- Defensive posture
- Instinctive response

### Physical Symptoms

- Tension in chest and shoulders
- Shallow breathing
- Muscle tightness
- Stomach distress
- Overall constriction

---

## The Posture-Anxiety Feedback Loop

### How Posture Reinforces Anxiety

**Collapsed posture:**
- Restricts breathing
- Signals threat to brain
- Feels powerless
- May increase anxiety

**Open posture:**
- Allows full breathing
- Signals safety
- Feels more capable
- May reduce anxiety

### Research Support

Studies show:
- Expansive postures can reduce cortisol
- Body position affects hormone levels
- Posture can influence feelings
- Not a cure, but a tool

## Using Posture as a Tool

### Before Anxiety-Provoking Situations

**Preparation:**
1. Find private space
2. Take expansive posture
3. Deep breathing
4. 2-3 minutes

**What to try:**

- Hands on hips (wonder woman pose)
- Any position that opens body

**The goal:**
- Reduce physiological stress response
- Feel more resourced
- Enter situation less constricted

### During Situations

**Reality:**
- Can't do power poses in meetings
- Need subtle approaches
- Small adjustments matter

**What works:**
- Feet grounded, planted firmly

- Shoulders back even slightly
- Hands visible, not hidden
- Taking up reasonable space

### After Challenging Situations

## Small Changes That Help

### Feet

**Instead of:**
- Feet crossed, locked
- Weight shifting nervously
- Ready to flee

**Try:**
- Feet flat, grounded
- Hip-width apart
- Even weight distribution
- Sense the ground

### Hands

**Instead of:**
- Hidden in pockets/sleeves
- Fidgeting constantly
- Crossed arms/self-holding

**Try:**
- Visible and relaxed
- Resting on table/lap
- Open, not clenched
- Purposeful gestures

### Eyes and Head

**Instead of:**
- Constant looking down
- Avoiding all eye contact
- Head ducked

**Try:**
- Comfortable gaze level
- Brief eye contact
- Head balanced (even if not looking at people)

### Chest and Shoulders

**Instead of:**
- Completely collapsed
- Protecting heart

**Try:**
- Even slightly more open
- Shoulders dropped from ears
- Chest lifted just a bit

## Breathing for Social Situations

### The Quick Reset

**Before/during:**
1. Slow exhale
2. Natural inhale
3. Repeat 3 times
4. Subtle, others won't notice

### Why It Works

- Activates calm response
- Counteracts shallow anxiety breathing
- Can do anywhere
- Immediately available

---

## Practicing When Safe

### Build the Skills Alone

**Daily practice:**
- Stand in power pose (private)
- Practice open posture
- Notice how it feels
- Build familiarity

### Gradual Exposure

**Progress:**
1. Practice alone
2. Practice with safe people
3. Low-stakes situations
4. More challenging gradually

### It Gets Easier

- Body remembers
- Less conscious effort over time

## Challenging the Thoughts

### "Everyone Is Looking"

**Reality:**
- People are mostly focused on themselves
- Your posture is less noticed than you think
- Small changes are subtle

### "I'll Look Arrogant"

**Reality:**
- Open posture ≠ arrogance
- Confident ≠ aggressive
- Taking up reasonable space is okay
- You deserve space too

### "It Won't Work for Me"

**Reality:**
- Not a cure, but a tool
- Every bit helps
- Combine with other strategies
- Worth trying
