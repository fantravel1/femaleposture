# Burnout and Your Body

> **Exhaustion Is Physical:** Burnout isn't just mental—it shows in your body. Understanding the physical signs helps you catch burnout earlier and protect yourself.

---

## What Burnout Looks Like Physically

### The Burnout Posture

**As energy depletes:**
- Shoulders droop
- Head comes forward
- Spine collapses
- Everything sinks

**It's not laziness:**
- Muscles are fatigued
- Energy is depleted
- Body reflects internal state
- Hard to maintain good posture without energy

### Physical Symptoms

- Chronic fatigue
- Muscle tension
- Headaches
- Sleep problems
- Weakened immunity
- Digestive issues
- Chronic pain

---

## The Burnout-Posture Cycle

### How It Builds

1. Work stress increases
2. Tension accumulates
3. Sleep deteriorates
4. Energy drops
5. Posture collapses
6. Pain increases
7. More stress
8. Repeat, worsening

### Breaking the Cycle

Addressing posture alone isn't enough, but it's one entry point into the cycle.

## Gentle Approaches When Burned Out

### The Irony

**You need:**
- Movement and exercise
- Good posture habits
- Self-care practices

**But you have:**
- No energy
- No time (in your mind)
- No motivation

### Meeting Yourself Where You Are

**Minimum viable movement:**
- 5-minute walks
- Gentle stretches at desk
- Just getting up hourly
- Not optimal, but something

**Reduced expectations:**
- Not the time for new exercise programs
- Maintenance mode
- Survival, then thriving

---

## When Everything Feels Too Hard

### Micro-Approaches

**Instead of:**
- 30-minute workout

**Try:**
- 1-minute stretches
- Walking to bathroom slowly
- One shoulder roll

**The point:**
- Keep some movement
- Maintain connection to body
- Prevent total collapse
- Build back when energy returns

### Prioritizing

**What helps most:**
- Sleep (non-negotiable)
- Basic nutrition
- Some movement
- Stress reduction

**What can wait:**
- Optimal posture
- Exercise programs
- Perfect ergonomics

## Protecting Your Body in Burnout

### Environment Adjustments

**Make it easier:**
- Best possible work setup
- Supportive chair
- Reduce physical strain
- Less work for exhausted body

### Energy Conservation

- Sit rather than stand if tired
- Take rest breaks
- Pace activities
- Don't add physical demands

### Gentle Support

- Heat for tense muscles
- Epsom salt baths
- Gentle massage
- Whatever feels restorative

---

## Sleep and Recovery

### Sleep Is Non-Negotiable

**Burnout recovery requires sleep:**
- Muscles repair during sleep
- Energy replenishes
- Stress hormones reset
- Posture is easier when rested

### Sleep Posture Matters More

**When you do sleep:**
- Supportive mattress
- Good pillow
- Comfortable position
- Not waking in pain

## Beginning Recovery

### Physical First Steps

**As energy returns:**
- Slightly longer walks
- Gentle stretching routines
- Body awareness practice
- Not intensive yet

### Rebuilding Gradually

**Don't:**
- Jump back into intense exercise
- Over-commit immediately
- Ignore warning signs

**Do:**
- Increase activity slowly
- Notice body signals
- Rest when needed
- Build sustainable habits

---

## Workplace Considerations

### Ergonomics When Exhausted

**Why it matters more:**
- Less energy to compensate
- Less awareness of position
- More likely to collapse into poor posture

**Adjustments:**
- Best possible setup
- Frequent reminders
- Supportive equipment

### Time and Breaks

**If you can:**
- Enforce break times
- Walk at lunch
- Don't work through everything
- Protect non-work time

Part of burnout prevention and recovery is boundaries—including physical ones like not working in bed.

---
