# Integration and the Body

Integration is wholeness—all parts of you working together as one coherent system. Physical integration means mind, body, and emotions functioning as unified whole rather than fragmented parts. This integration is the foundation of well-being.

## What Integration Means

### Physical Integration

- All parts connected
- Coordinated movement
- Unified function
- Coherent experience
- Body as whole

### Mind-Body Integration

**Unified system:**
- Mind and body connected
- Feelings in body recognized
- Thoughts affecting body acknowledged
- Whole-system awareness
- Integrated functioning

## Signs of Integration
