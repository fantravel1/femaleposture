# Osteoporosis Prevention During Menopause

> **Bone loss accelerates during menopause due to declining estrogen. Proactive steps now can protect your bones and reduce fracture risk for years to come.**

---

## Understanding the Risk

Menopause significantly increases osteoporosis risk.

### Why Menopause Matters

**What happens:**
- Estrogen protects bones
- Estrogen drops in menopause
- Bone loss accelerates
- 10-20% bone loss possible in first 5-7 years
- Risk increases thereafter

### Who's at Higher Risk

**Risk factors include:**
- Family history of osteoporosis
- Small, thin frame
- Early menopause
- Smoking
- Excessive alcohol
- Low calcium intake
- Sedentary lifestyle

---

## Exercise for Bones

**Stimulates bone building:**
- Walking and hiking
- Jogging (if tolerated)
- Dancing
- Stair climbing
- Tennis and similar sports

### Resistance Training

**Essential for bones:**
- Strengthens muscles pulling on bones
- Direct bone stimulation
- Squats and lunges
- Deadlifts
- Standing exercises

### High-Impact Exercise

**If appropriate:**
- Jumping exercises
- Skipping rope
- Higher impact stimulates bones
- Not for everyone
- Consider current bone health

### Balance Training

**Prevents falls:**
