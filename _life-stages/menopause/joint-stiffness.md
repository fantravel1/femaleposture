# Joint Stiffness During Menopause

> **Waking up feeling like the Tin Man? Declining estrogen affects joint health, but the right movement and posture strategies can keep you moving freely.**

## Understanding Menopausal Joint Stiffness

Joint stiffness and achiness during menopause is so common it has a name: menopausal arthralgia. Understanding why it happens helps you address it effectively.

### The Estrogen-Joint Connection

**How hormones affect joints:**
- Estrogen maintains joint cartilage
- Hormone decline reduces lubrication
- Inflammation levels may increase
- Collagen production decreases
- Tendons and ligaments lose elasticity

### Common Symptoms

**What you might experience:**
- Morning stiffness lasting 30+ minutes
- Achiness in multiple joints
- Stiffness after sitting still
- Reduced range of motion
- Crackling or popping sounds

### Most Affected Areas

**Joints that typically stiffen:**
- Fingers and hands
- Knees
- Hips
- Lower back
- Neck and shoulders
- Feet and ankles

## Morning Routine for Stiff Joints

### Before Getting Out of Bed

**Gentle wake-up movements:**
- Wiggle fingers and toes
- Make fists, then spread fingers wide
- Point and flex feet
- Gently bend and straighten knees

### Gentle Morning Stretches

**First movements of the day:**
- Hug knees to chest while lying down
- Gentle twist, knees side to side

### Warm Shower Strategy

**Use heat to loosen joints:**
- Let warm water run over stiff areas
- Move joints under water stream
- Gentle stretches in shower
- Take time—rushing increases stiffness
- Pat dry gently, don't rub

- Regular movement prevents decline

### Movement Breaks

**Break up sitting time:**
- Stand and move every 30 minutes
- Walk while on phone calls
- Take stairs when possible
- Park farther away from destinations
