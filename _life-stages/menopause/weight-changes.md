# Menopause Weight Changes and Posture

> **A Shifting Center:** Even without significant weight gain, menopause changes where weight sits on your body. This affects posture and movement.

---

## What Changes During Menopause

### Hormonal Effects on Weight

**What happens:**
- Estrogen decline affects fat distribution
- Metabolic rate often decreases
- Muscle mass may decline
- Weight tends to shift to midsection

### Body Composition Shifts

**Even at same weight:**
- Fat distribution changes
- Muscle mass may decrease
- Body shape changes
- Center of gravity shifts

---

## How This Affects Posture

### Center of Gravity

**Changes in weight distribution:**
- More weight in midsection
- Center of gravity shifts forward
- Affects balance
- Requires posture adaptation

### Compensations

**Body may adapt by:**
- Increased lower back curve
- Leaning backward
- Changed gait
- Different movement patterns

---

## Managing the Changes

### Strength Training Is Key

**Why essential:**
- Preserves/builds muscle mass
- Supports metabolism
- Maintains strength
- Improves posture

**Focus on:**
- Core strength
- Full body strength
- Regular practice
- Progressive challenge

### Core Work

**Particularly important:**

- Maintains posture
- Protects back
