# Retirement Activity Planning

Retirement often coincides with or follows menopause, creating significant life transition. The sudden absence of work structure can affect physical activity patterns—for better or worse. Some retirees become more active with newfound time; others become sedentary without the forced movement of work. Planning your physical activity strategy for retirement supports long-term health.
