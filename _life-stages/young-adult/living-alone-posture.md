# Living Alone and Posture

> **No One's Watching—Except Future You:** When you live alone, no one tells you to sit up straight. Building your own accountability matters.

---

## The Living Alone Challenge

### No External Checks

**What's missing:**
- No one notices your slouching
- No reminder to take breaks
- No one judging your couch time
- Complete autonomy (good and bad)

### What Often Happens

**Without accountability:**
- Posture degrades at home
- Couch becomes workstation
- Movement decreases
- Habits slip

---

## Creating Your Own Accountability

### Environmental Cues

**Set up your space:**
- Mirror where you work
- Timer or app for breaks
- Dedicated work space (not bed)
- Furniture that supports posture

### Technology Helps

**Use tools:**
- Posture reminder apps
- Movement reminders
- Standing desk timers
- Whatever works for you

### Routines as Accountability

**Build structure:**
- Morning routine
- Scheduled exercise
- Regular movement breaks
- Evening wind-down

---

## Home Setup When Alone

### Workspace

**Even for yourself:**
- Proper desk setup
- Ergonomic chair
- Not working from bed/couch
- See [Home Office Setup](/tools/home-office-setup-checklist/)

### Living Space

**Comfort vs. posture:**
- Couch for relaxation is fine
- But not all-day location
- Variety of seating options
- Movement is key

---

## The Couch Trap

### What Happens

**Common pattern:**
- Work from home (on couch)
- Meals (on couch)
- Entertainment (on couch)
- Sleep disruption (couch naps)

### Better Approach

**Create variety:**
- Desk for work
- Table for meals
- Couch for intentional relaxation
- Bed for sleep only

---

## Movement Without Motivation

### When No One Knows

**Easy to skip:**
- Exercise
- Stretching
- Movement breaks
- Posture attention

### Finding Motivation

**What helps:**
- Scheduled classes (accountability)
- Workout buddies
- Apps with streaks
- Future self focus

---

## Self-Care Basics

### Prioritizing Yourself

**When alone:**
- Easy to neglect self-care
- No one to impress
- Basic health matters
- You're worth it

### Non-Negotiables

**Maintain:**
- Regular movement
- Basic posture awareness
- Adequate sleep
- Health attention

---

## Video Calls and Posture

### Seeing Yourself

**Useful feedback:**
- You see your own posture
- Awareness increases
- May motivate improvement
- Natural accountability

### Working With It

**Use calls to:**
- Check your posture
- Notice patterns
- Make adjustments
- Build awareness

---

## Social Eating vs. Alone Eating

### Meal Posture

**When alone:**
- Often eat at counter
- Standing at kitchen
- In front of screen
- Walking around

**Better practice:**

- Mindful eating
- Good posture practice
- Even alone

---

## Evening Routines

### After Work

**Without others:**
