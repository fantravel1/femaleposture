# Interview Presence and Body Language

> **In interviews, your body language speaks before you do—and continues communicating throughout. Master the physical presence that complements your qualifications.**

---

## Why Body Language Matters in Interviews

Studies suggest that nonverbal communication accounts for a significant portion of first impressions. In an interview setting, your posture and body language can reinforce—or undermine—everything you say.

### What Interviewers Notice

**Key body language elements:**
- Handshake quality
- Eye contact patterns
- Posture and positioning
- Hand gestures and movements
- Facial expressions
- Nervous habits

### The Confidence Paradox

**Even when nervous:**
- Confident body language helps you feel confident
- Interviewers expect some nervousness
- How you manage nerves matters
- Posture affects voice quality
- Physical presence conveys capability

## Before the Interview

### The Power Pose Technique

**Prepare your body:**
- Find private space (restroom, car)
- Stand with feet wide, hands on hips
- Or raise arms in V-shape
- Hold for 2 minutes
- This shifts your body chemistry

### Arrival Posture

**Enter with presence:**
- Walk in with purpose, moderate pace
- Shoulders back, head up
- Smile genuinely at everyone
