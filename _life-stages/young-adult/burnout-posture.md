# Burnout and Body Posture

> **Burnout doesn't just exhaust your mind—it shows up in your body. Learning to read and respond to physical signs can help you recover and protect your wellbeing.**

## The Body-Burnout Connection

Burnout affects more than your energy levels. Chronic stress and exhaustion create patterns in how you hold and move your body.

### Physical Signs of Burnout

**What your body shows:**
- Chronic slumped posture
- Tension in shoulders and neck
- Shallow, restricted breathing
- Fatigue despite rest
- Persistent muscle aches

### The Postural Collapse

**How burnout looks physically:**
- Shoulders round forward
- Head drops or juts forward
- Chest caves inward
- Core disengages
- Overall collapse and shrinking

---

## Understanding the Stress Response

### Chronic Stress Effects

**Body under constant pressure:**
- Muscles stay tensed
- Breathing becomes shallow
- Cortisol remains elevated
- Recovery never happens
- Body systems deteriorate

### The Protective Curl

**Why we collapse:**
- Body protects vital organs
- Instinctive defensive posture
- Energy conservation mode
- Physical manifestation of emotional state
- Becomes habitual over time

## Posture Assessment

### Signs to Notice

**Check yourself for:**

### The Mirror Test
