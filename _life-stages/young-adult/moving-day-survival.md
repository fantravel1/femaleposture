# Moving Day Physical Survival

Moving day is one of the most physically demanding days you might experience. Hours of lifting, carrying, climbing stairs, and loading vehicles challenge even fit bodies. Whether you're moving yourself or directing movers, attention to physical well-being prevents injury and reduces recovery time.

## Pre-Move Preparation

### Physical Conditioning
If possible, prepare your body with strength and endurance work.

### Sleep Before
Get good sleep before moving day.

### Nutrition
Eat well in the days before the move.

### Supplies Ready
Have water, snacks, and first aid accessible.

## If You're Moving Yourself

### Proper Box Weights
Pack boxes to manageable weights.

### Lift Technique
Bend at knees, keep load close, lift with legs.

### Team Lifting
Use two people for heavy or awkward items.

### Rest Breaks
Schedule regular breaks—every 20-30 minutes.

## If Using Movers

### Clear Paths
Your job is ensuring clear pathways.

### Direct Traffic
Point and direct rather than lift.

### Final Sweep
Walk through to catch forgotten items.

### Physical Reserve
Save energy for unpacking at the destination.

## Lifting Fundamentals

### Assess First
Judge weight and plan your lift before picking up.

### Squat Down
Bend at knees, not at waist.

### Close Hold
Keep loads close to your body.

### Stable Base
Feet shoulder-width apart for stability.

### No Twisting
Turn feet, not torso, when changing direction.

## Stair Navigation

### One Box at a Time
Don't carry multiple items on stairs.

### Handrail Use
Use handrails when possible, even if carrying.

### Careful Footing
Watch each step; don't rush.

### Two-Person Heavy Items
Large items always need two people on stairs.

## Truck Loading

### Strategic Packing
Heavy items low, lighter items high.

### Stable Stacking
Prevent shifting during transport.

### Loading Position
Position yourself safely when lifting into truck.

### Step Use
Use truck steps properly rather than jumping.

## Throughout the Day

### Hydration
Drink water consistently throughout moving day.

### Food Breaks
Take actual meal breaks; don't skip eating.

### Stretching
Brief stretches during breaks prevent stiffness.

### Energy Pacing
Start sustainable; don't burn out early.

## Common Injuries to Prevent

### Back Strain
Improper lifting is the primary cause.

### Hand Injuries
Wear gloves; be careful with sharp edges.

### Foot Injuries
Wear closed-toe, supportive shoes.

### Fatigue Injuries
Being tired leads to careless movement.

## After Moving Day

### Gentle Movement
Light walking helps more than complete rest.

### Stretching
Stretch major muscle groups used.

### Hydration Continues
Keep drinking water for recovery.

### Sleep Recovery
Get good sleep post-move.

## Unpacking Pace

### Priority Unpacking
Set up essentials first; don't rush everything.

### Position Awareness
Maintain good posture while unpacking.

### Box Breakdown
Break down boxes to clear space safely.

### Gradual Process
Spread unpacking over days, not hours.

## When to Get Help

### Pain Signals
Sharp pain means stop and assess.

### Medical Attention
Seek care for concerning symptoms.

### Professional Movers
Sometimes hiring help is the wisest choice.

### Physical Limits
Know your limits and respect them.

Moving is temporary, but injury can have lasting effects. Taking care of your body during moving day protects your ability to enjoy your new home.
