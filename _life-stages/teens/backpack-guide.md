# Backpack Guide for Teens

> **Pack It Right:** Heavy, poorly worn backpacks can affect developing posture. This guide helps teens (and parents) choose and wear backpacks properly.

---

## Why Backpacks Matter for Posture

### The Problem

Many students:
- Carry 20-30% of body weight daily
- Wear packs too low or on one shoulder
- Carry unnecessary items
- Use poorly designed bags

### The Effects

Heavy or improper backpacks can:
- Cause forward lean
- Create rounded shoulders
- Strain back and neck
- Cause pain
- Potentially affect developing spines

---

## Weight Guidelines

### How Much Is Too Much?

**Recommended limit:**
- 10-15% of body weight maximum
- Less is better

**Example:**
- 120 lb teen: max 12-18 lbs
- 100 lb teen: max 10-15 lbs

### Reality Check

Many students carry:
- Multiple textbooks
- Laptop or tablet
- Water bottle
- Lunch
- Sports equipment
- Much more than 15%

---

## Choosing the Right Backpack

### Size Matters

**Fit to body:**
- Top below base of skull
- Bottom at waist (not below hips)
- Doesn't extend beyond sides of body
- Not so big it invites overloading

### Key Features

**Essential:**
- Wide, padded straps (2+ inches)
- Padded back panel
- Chest and waist strap
- Multiple compartments
- Durable construction

**Helpful:**
- Compression straps
- Reflective elements
- Water bottle pocket (external)
- Laptop sleeve (if needed)

### What to Avoid

- One-strap designs for heavy loads
- Fashion over function
- Too large for the body
- Thin, unpadded straps
- Heavy pack when empty

## How to Wear It Right

### Both Straps, Always

**Why:**
- Distributes weight evenly
- Prevents side-leaning
- Reduces muscle strain
- Better balance

**One shoulder problems:**
- Uneven loading
- Shoulder hiking
- Spine tilting
- Muscle imbalances

### Proper Strap Adjustment

**Height:**
- Pack sits at mid-back
- Not hanging below waist
- Not too high on shoulders

**Tightness:**
- Snug against back
- No sagging or swaying
- Should feel secure

### Use the Waist Strap

**Benefits:**
- Transfers weight to hips
- Reduces shoulder load
- Stabilizes pack
- Less back strain

**When to use:**
- Heavy loads
- Long carrying times
- Extended walking

### Use the Chest Strap

**Benefits:**
- Keeps straps in place
- Prevents shoulder sliding
- Improves stability
- Distributes load

---

## Packing Strategies

### Organize by Weight

**Heaviest items:**
- Closest to back
- Centered
- Low in the pack

**Lighter items:**
- Outer pockets
- Top of pack
- Away from back

### Only What You Need

**Review daily:**
- Take only day's materials
- Use locker if available
- Don't carry "just in case" items
- Digital options when possible

### Reduce Weight

**Strategies:**
- Digital textbooks if available
