# Postpartum Sleep Deprivation and Posture

> **Exhausted Beyond Words:** New parent sleep deprivation is legendary. Here's how it affects your body and what you can do about it.

---

## How Sleep Deprivation Affects Posture

### The Physical Reality

**When exhausted:**
- Postural muscles tire faster
- Slouching becomes default
- Body awareness decreases
- Muscle tension increases paradoxically
- Pain tolerance drops

### The Cycle

**Exhaustion leads to:**
- Poor posture → more strain
- More strain → more pain
- More pain → worse sleep
- Worse sleep → more exhaustion
- Repeat

## What Happens to Your Body

### Muscle Effects

**Tired muscles:**
- Can't hold positions as long

- Recovery is compromised
- Weakness compounds

### Tension Patterns

**Paradoxically:**
- Stress hormones increase with poor sleep
- Muscle tension often increases
- Shoulders creep up
- Jaw clenches

### Pain Sensitivity

**Sleep-deprived bodies:**
- Feel pain more intensely
- Recover from pain more slowly
- May develop new pain
- Everything hurts more
