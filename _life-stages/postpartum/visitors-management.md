# Managing Visitors Postpartum

Everyone wants to meet the baby, but a constant stream of visitors can exhaust a recovering postpartum body. You're still bleeding, possibly struggling with breastfeeding, definitely sleep-deprived, and physically healing. Managing visitors protects your recovery while allowing meaningful connections with people who love you and your baby.

## Physical Recovery Priority

## Setting Boundaries

Require advance notice rather than drop-in visits.

Limit visitors to one or two per day maximum.

### Night Boundaries
No evening visitors when you're trying to establish sleep patterns.

Don't get up to host; let visitors come to you.

### Rest Before
Rest before scheduled visits.

### Recover After

## Partner's Role

### Shared Responsibility
Both of you manage your shared boundaries.

## Signs You Need Fewer Visitors

If you're not recovering, reduce visits.

### Crying or Irritability

### Healing Issues
If physical healing is suffering.

## Long-Term View

### Relationships Survive
People who love you will understand limits.

### No Rush
There's plenty of time for everyone to meet the baby.

### Recovery First
Better recovery now means more capacity later.

### Your Baby's Whole Life
Baby will have their whole life for visitors to know them.
