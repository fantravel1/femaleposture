# Diaper Changing Posture

> **You'll change thousands of diapers in the first years—each one an opportunity to protect or strain your back. Good technique during this repetitive task prevents accumulated injury.**

---

## Why It Matters

Diaper changes add up significantly.

### The Numbers

**How much:**

- Thousands per year
- Multiple years

- Neck tension
- Shoulder pain
- Cumulative injury
- Preventable issues

- Right height crucial

### If Too Low

**Adjustments:**
