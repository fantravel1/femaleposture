# Postpartum Posture Recovery: Complete Guide

> **Your body just did something amazing.** Now it needs time and the right approach to recover. This guide walks you through posture recovery from the first days through the first year and beyond.

---

## What's Happening to Your Body

After delivery, your body begins reversing nine months of adaptations:

**Ligaments:** Relaxin remains elevated for several months (longer if breastfeeding), keeping joints loose
**Abdominals:** May be separated (diastasis recti) and significantly weakened
**Pelvic floor:** Recovering from pressure and potentially from tearing or episiotomy
**Posture:** The patterns developed during pregnancy don't immediately reset
**Hormones:** Fluctuating, affecting mood, energy, and tissue healing

### Timeline of Recovery

| Time Postpartum | What's Happening |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Week 1-2 | Initial healing; rest is priority |
| Week 2-6 | Early recovery; gentle movement begins |
| Week 6-12 | Progressive strengthening; exercise resumption |
| 3-6 months | Continued healing; strength building |
| 6-12 months | Near full recovery for most (varies widely) |
| 12+ months | Ongoing maintenance; addressing persistent issues |

## Immediate Postpartum (Days 1-14)

### Priority: Rest and Healing

In the first two weeks, focus on:
- **Rest** — Sleep when baby sleeps when possible
- **Nutrition** — Support tissue healing
- **Gentle movement** — Short walks when comfortable
- **Positions** — Support while feeding and resting

### Basic Movements

Even in the first days, gentle movements help:

**Diaphragmatic breathing:**
1. Lie comfortably on your back or side
2. Place hands on belly
3. Breathe slowly into your belly
4. Exhale fully
5. Do 5-10 breaths several times daily

**Pelvic floor awareness:**
1. When comfortable (not if stitches are painful)
2. Gently contract pelvic floor muscles
3. Hold 3-5 seconds
4. Release fully
5. Just a few repetitions—don't overdo

### Posture Awareness

- **Feeding:** Support arms with pillows, sit back in chair
- **Sleeping:** Side-lying with pillows for support
- **Getting up:** Roll to side, push up with arms

---

## Early Recovery (Weeks 2-6)

### Gentle Exercises to Begin

Around 2 weeks (with provider clearance), begin:

**Connection breath:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Inhale—belly expands
3. Exhale—gently engage pelvic floor and deep core
4. Feel gentle "hugging" of muscles
5. 10 repetitions, several times daily

**Heel slides:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Exhale and engage core
3. Slowly slide one heel away
4. Inhale, return to start
5. 10 each side

**Gentle glute bridges:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Exhale, engage pelvic floor
3. Lift hips slightly (just a few inches)
4. Hold 3 seconds
5. Lower slowly
6. 10 repetitions

### Diastasis Recti Check

Check for abdominal separation around 2 weeks:

1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Place fingers just above belly button
3. Lift head slightly (not full crunch)
4. Feel for a gap between rectus muscles
5. Measure in finger-widths

**Results:**
- 1-2 finger gap: Common, often resolves naturally
- 2-3 finger gap: Will benefit from targeted exercises
- 3+ finger gap: Consider seeing a pelvic floor PT

## Progressive Recovery (Weeks 6-12)

### After 6-Week Checkup

With provider clearance, progress to:

**Dead bug (modified):**
1. Lie on back, knees bent 90°, shins parallel to floor
2. Press lower back into floor
3. Exhale, lower one leg toward floor (not all the way)
4. Inhale, return
5. Alternate sides, 10 each

**Bird dog:**
1. Hands and knees, spine neutral
2. Exhale, extend opposite arm and leg
3. Keep hips level
4. Hold 3 seconds
5. 10 each side

**Side-lying hip work:**
1. Lie on side, knees bent
2. Clamshells: Keep feet together, open top knee
3. Side-lying leg lifts: Straighten top leg, lift
4. 15 repetitions each

### Exercises to AVOID

Until core and pelvic floor are strong:
- Crunches or sit-ups
- Planks (until diastasis closes)
- Running or jumping
- Heavy lifting
- Anything that causes doming of abdomen

## Breastfeeding Posture

### Why It Matters

Breastfeeding can mean 8+ hours daily in forward-hunched positions. Without attention, this creates:
- Rounded shoulders
- Forward head posture
- Upper back pain
- Neck tension
- Wrist and thumb pain

### Better Positioning

**The key principle:** Bring baby to breast; don't hunch down to baby.

**Laid-back nursing (biological nurturing):**
- Recline at 45° angle
- Baby on your chest
- Gravity holds baby in place
- Minimal arm and back strain

**Side-lying nursing:**
- Lie on your side
- Baby faces you at breast level
- Pillow between knees
- Great for night feeds

**Upright positions:**
- Sit fully back in chair
- Use nursing pillow to raise baby
- Keep feet supported
- Support arm with armrest or pillow

### Between Feeds

**Shoulder rolls:**
- Roll shoulders forward, up, back, down
- 5-10 circles each direction

**Doorway chest stretch:**
- Stand in doorway
- Forearms on frame
- Lean through gently
- Hold 20-30 seconds

**Chin tucks:**
- Draw chin straight back
- Hold 5 seconds
- 10 repetitions

## C-Section Recovery

### Special Considerations

C-section recovery adds complexity:
- Abdominal incision needs to heal
- Core activation is more difficult initially
- Scar tissue can affect mobility
- Recovery timeline is typically longer

### Movement Modifications

**First 2 weeks:**
- Gentle walking
- Breathing exercises
- No lifting more than baby

**Weeks 2-6:**
- Gentle scar mobility (once healed)
- Connection breath
- Very gentle core work

**After 6 weeks:**
- Progress similar to vaginal delivery
- Be mindful of scar sensation
- May need scar tissue massage

### Getting Up

Use the log-roll technique:
1. Roll onto your side as a unit
2. Push up with arms
3. Swing legs off bed
4. Stand slowly

Avoid sit-ups to get out of bed—they strain the incision.

## Baby Carrying

### Carrying Positions

**In arms:**
- Switch sides regularly
- Keep baby close to your body
- Avoid hip carry for extended periods (creates asymmetry)

**In carrier:**
- Ensure carrier supports baby in "M" position
- Adjust straps for weight on hips, not shoulders
- Keep baby high and tight
- Face baby inward initially

See our [Baby Carrier Guide](/life-stages/postpartum/baby-carrier-guide/)

### Lifting

**How to lift baby:**
1. Engage core before lifting
2. Bend at hips and knees
3. Keep baby close to body
4. Exhale as you lift
5. Avoid twisting while lifting

## When to See a Professional

### Normal Postpartum Experiences

- Some abdominal weakness
- Mild diastasis recti (1-2 fingers)
- Occasional back discomfort
- Needing time to return to exercise

### See a Pelvic Floor PT If

- Leaking urine with activity
- Heaviness or bulge in vaginal area
- Pain with intercourse
- Diastasis recti not improving
- Persistent back or pelvic pain
- Difficulty returning to exercise

### See Your Provider If

- Severe pain
- Wound healing concerns
- Signs of infection
- Depression or anxiety affecting function

---

## Return to Exercise Timeline

### General Guidelines

**Weeks 0-6:**
- Walking
- Breathing exercises
- Gentle pelvic floor work
- Gentle stretching

**Weeks 6-12:**
- Progress core exercises
- Light resistance training
- Swimming (once cleared)
- Low-impact activities

**3-6 months:**
- Return to most exercises
- Begin running (if ready—see below)
- Progress intensity gradually

### Return to Running

Don't rush back to running. Guidelines suggest:
- Wait at least 3 months postpartum
- Be able to do single-leg balance, hopping, running in place without symptoms
- Have good core and pelvic floor strength
- Start with walk-run intervals

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing back to exercise** — Take the time you need
2. **Ignoring pelvic floor** — It needs attention even if you feel fine
3. **Doing crunches to "get abs back"** — Can worsen diastasis
4. **Sitting hunched while feeding** — Sets up postural problems
5. **Never taking breaks from baby** — You need recovery time too
6. **Comparing to others** — Every recovery is different
