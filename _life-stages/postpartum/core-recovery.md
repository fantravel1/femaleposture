# Postpartum Core Recovery

> **Rebuilding From the Inside Out:** Your core needs time and appropriate exercises to recover. Patience and proper progression matter.

## Understanding Postpartum Core

### What Happened

**During pregnancy:**

**Core includes:**
- Transverse abdominis (deep)
- Rectus abdominis (six-pack)
- Obliques
- Pelvic floor
- Back muscles
- Diaphragm

---

## Recovery Timeline

### First Weeks

**0-6 weeks:**

- Very gentle activation only
- Breathing exercises
- No real exercise yet

### 6-12 Weeks

**With clearance:**
- Begin gentle exercises
- Focus on connection
- Gradually progress
- Listen to your body

### 3-6 Months

**Building:**
- More exercise variety
- Increasing challenge
- Functional movements
- Continued progression

### 6+ Months

**Continuing:**
- More advanced options
- Return to activities
- Ongoing maintenance
- Full recovery varies

## Starting Point: Connection

### Breathing

**Foundation exercise:**

- Feel belly and ribs expand
- Pelvic floor gentle engagement
- Core activation with exhale

### Finding Your Core

**Learning to engage:**
- Gentle draw-in of lower belly
- Like zipping up from pubic bone
- Not sucking in
- Light activation

### Pelvic Floor Connection

**Integrated:**
