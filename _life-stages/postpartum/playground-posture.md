# Playground Posture for Parents

> **Between pushing swings, catching at slides, and chasing around the park, playground time can be surprisingly physical. Smart body mechanics keep you comfortable.**

---

## Playground Physical Demands

### What Playground Time Involves

### Why It's Hard on Bodies

**Physical challenges:**
- Equipment sized for children
- Repetitive motions

## Swing Duty

### Pushing Swings

**Protecting your back:**

### Loading and Unloading

**Safe lifting:**

- Don't twist and lift
- Hold child close

### Bucket Swing Challenges

- Multiple trips daily adds up

## Slide Supervision

### Catching at Bottom

**Positioning yourself:**

## Walking with Toddlers

### The Toddler Stoop

**Bent-over walking:**

### Hand-Holding Heights

**Reaching down constantly:**

## Sitting at Playgrounds

### Benches and Options
