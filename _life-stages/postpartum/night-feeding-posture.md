# Night Feeding Posture

> **Those middle-of-the-night feeds are exhausting enough without adding physical strain. The right positioning protects your body while keeping you and baby safe.**

---

## Why Night Feeding Posture Matters

When you're half-asleep and feeding your baby, poor positioning can cause problems.

### Common Issues from Poor Night Posture

**What can happen:**
- Neck pain from looking down
- Shoulder strain from holding position
- Back pain from hunching
- Wrist pain from gripping
- Cumulative strain from repeated feedings

### Fatigue Compounds Problems

**Tired bodies are vulnerable:**
- Less muscle engagement when exhausted
- Positions held longer as you doze
- Awareness decreases
- Pain may not register until morning
- Good setup prevents problems

---

## Side-Lying Position

### For Breastfeeding

**Most restful option:**
- Lie on side facing baby
- Baby also on side, facing you
- Support baby's back with rolled blanket
- Baby's mouth at nipple level
- Your bottom arm out of the way

### Proper Alignment

**Keep spine supported:**
- Pillow under head supporting neck
- Lower arm under pillow or extended
- Top arm drapes over baby or rests
- Pillow between knees for hip alignment
- Comfortable mattress underneath

### Safety Considerations

**Following safe sleep guidance:**
- Remove extra pillows and blankets near baby
- Clear surface around baby
- No sleeping baby in adult bed (transfer after feeding)
- Follow safe sleep recommendations
- Stay awake enough to be aware

---

## Seated Night Feeding

### Chair or Glider Setup

**Prepare before night:**
- Comfortable chair at feeding station
- Nursing pillow readily available
- Footstool if needed
- Water and necessities within reach
- Small light (red/amber preferred)

### Proper Seated Position

**Even when sleepy:**
- Sit back fully in chair
- Support lower back
- Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby
- Use nursing pillow for support
- Feet flat or on footstool

### For Bottle Feeding

**Same principles apply:**
- Baby elevated, not flat
- Bottle at appropriate angle
- Elbow supported
- Wrist neutral, not bent
- Switch sides between feeds

---

## Bed Feeding While Seated

### Propped-Up Position

**When staying in bed:**
- Sit up against headboard
- Many pillows behind back
- Nursing pillow on lap
- Knees slightly bent with pillow
- Comfortable but alert enough

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

**Don't:**
- Hunch over baby
- Twist to one side
- Hold baby without support
- Tense shoulders up
- Strain neck looking down

---

## Positioning for Different Ages

### Newborn Nights

**Smallest babies:**
- Need more support
- Side-lying works well
- Frequent feedings
- Keep setups simple
- Support tiny head and neck

### As Baby Grows

**Adjustments over time:**
- Less support needed for baby
- May need larger nursing pillow
- Feeding becomes faster
- Positions can vary more
- Continue protecting yourself

## Creating Your Night Station

### Lighting Considerations

**Protect sleep for both:**

## Minimizing Movement
