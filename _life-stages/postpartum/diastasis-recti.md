# Diastasis Recti: Complete Postpartum Guide

> **Quick Summary:** Diastasis recti is the separation of the rectus abdominis (your "six-pack" muscles) that occurs in nearly all pregnancies. While some separation is normal and often resolves naturally, significant diastasis affects core function, posture, and can contribute to back pain. The condition is highly treatable with the right approach.

---

## Key Takeaways

- 100% of women have some diastasis recti by the end of pregnancy
- For 60% of women, it naturally resolves by 6 weeks postpartum
- About 40% still have diastasis at 6 months postpartum
- Tension and function matter more than gap size
- Certain exercises can worsen the condition; others help it heal
- It's never too late to address diastasis, even years after pregnancy

---

## What Is Diastasis Recti?

The linea alba is the connective tissue that runs down the center of your abdomen, connecting the two sides of the rectus abdominis ("six-pack") muscles. During pregnancy, this tissue stretches to accommodate your growing baby.

Diastasis recti (DR) occurs when:
- The linea alba stretches and thins
- A gap develops between the two muscle bellies
- The tissue may not fully recover postpartum

**Technical definition:** A separation greater than 2 finger-widths (about 2cm) at any point along the linea alba.

### Why It Matters

Diastasis affects more than appearance:

**Core function:** The deep core muscles work together as a system. DR compromises this system, affecting:
- Stability during movement
- Load transfer through the trunk
- Breathing patterns
- Pelvic floor function

**Posture:** Without effective core support:
- Lower back may overwork
- Anterior pelvic tilt often increases
- Back pain is more common

**Appearance:** DR can cause:
- "Mommy pooch" that doesn't respond to exercise
- Doming or coning when you activate abs
- Visible gap when lying down

## How to Check for Diastasis Recti

### Self-Assessment

**Best time to check:** 2+ weeks postpartum (after initial swelling subsides)

**Instructions:**

1. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on floor
2. Place fingertips horizontally across your belly button
3. Lift your head and shoulders slightly (like starting a crunch)
4. Feel for a gap between the two muscle bellies
5. Measure the width in finger-widths
6. Also check 2 inches above and 2 inches below belly button

**What you're assessing:**

- **Width:** How many fingers fit in the gap?
- **Depth:** How deep do your fingers sink?
- **Tension:** Does the tissue feel firm or soft when you activate?

### Interpreting Results

| Gap Width | Classification | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1-2 fingers | Normal/Mild | Home exercises, usually resolves |
| 2-3 fingers | Moderate | Targeted exercises, may need guidance |
| 3+ fingers | Significant | Professional assessment recommended |

**Important:** Width is just one factor. Depth and tension matter too. A 3-finger gap with good tension may function better than a 2-finger gap with no tension.

## What Causes Diastasis Recti?

### During Pregnancy

- Stretching of the abdominal wall to accommodate baby
- Hormones (relaxin) softening connective tissue
- Increased intra-abdominal pressure

### Risk Factors

- Multiple pregnancies
- Carrying multiples
- Large baby or excess amniotic fluid
- Weak abdominal muscles before pregnancy
- Older maternal age
- Certain movement patterns during pregnancy

### What Doesn't Cause It

- Exercising during pregnancy (in fact, strong abs may be protective)
- Your size before pregnancy
- How much weight you gained

---

## The Posture Connection

Diastasis recti and posture are deeply connected:

### How DR Affects Posture

Without effective core support:
- Lower back muscles compensate, often causing pain
- Pelvis may tilt forward (anterior tilt)
- Upper back may round forward
- Breathing patterns may be affected

### How Posture Affects DR

Poor posture can:
- Increase pressure on the linea alba
- Prevent healing
- Worsen separation

**Common problematic patterns:**
- Constant abdominal bracing/sucking in
- Breath-holding during exertion
- Thrusting ribs forward
- Excessive anterior pelvic tilt

## Exercises That HELP

### Foundation: Connection Breath

This is where all DR recovery begins:

1. Lie on your back, knees bent, or in side-lying
2. Place hands on belly
3. Inhale: Let belly expand naturally
4. Exhale: Gently draw pelvic floor up and belly button toward spine
5. It's subtle—like 30% effort, not a hard squeeze
6. Practice 10-20 breaths, several times daily

### Progressive Exercises

**Week 2+: Heel Slides**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Exhale, engage connection breath
3. Slowly slide one heel away
4. Only go as far as you can maintain engagement
5. Inhale, return
6. 10 each side

**Week 3+: Toe Taps**
1. Lie on back, legs in tabletop (knees over hips)
2. Exhale, engage
3. Lower one toe toward floor
4. Only go as far as you maintain control (no doming)
5. Inhale, return
6. 10 each side

**Week 4+: Dead Bug (Modified)**
1. Lie on back, legs in tabletop, arms reaching up
2. Exhale, engage
3. Lower opposite arm and leg toward floor
4. Keep back pressed into floor
5. 10 each side

**Week 6+: Bird Dog**
1. Hands and knees
2. Spine neutral (not arched or rounded)
3. Exhale, extend opposite arm and leg
4. Keep hips level, no rotation
5. 10 each side

### Key Principles

- **Progress slowly** — Master each exercise before moving on
- **No doming** — If you see bulging along midline, make the exercise easier
- **Exhale on effort** — This coordinates core and pelvic floor
- **Quality over quantity** — 10 perfect reps beats 30 sloppy ones

## Exercises to AVOID

Until your DR has improved significantly:

### Definitely Avoid

- **Crunches and sit-ups:** Create pressure that pushes gap open
- **Traditional planks:** Too much pressure for compromised core
- **Leg lifts (lying down):** Heavy load for healing abs
- **Double leg lowers:** Same issue
- **V-sits:** Maximum pressure on linea alba

### Be Cautious With

- Rotating movements (Russian twists, bicycles)
- Heavy lifting
- High-impact activities
- Anything that causes visible doming

### How to Know If Something Is Too Much

**Stop if you see:**
- Doming or coning along midline
- Belly "popping up" rather than staying flat

**Stop if you feel:**
- Pressure pushing outward
- Like you can't control the movement

## Healing Timeline

### Realistic Expectations

| Timeframe | What's Happening |
|-----------|------------------|
| 0-6 weeks | Natural closure occurring; rest and gentle work |
| 6-12 weeks | Progressive exercises; noticeable improvement |
| 3-6 months | Continued healing; most see significant closure |
| 6-12 months | Near maximum natural healing |
| 12+ months | Maintenance; further work still possible |

### Factors That Affect Healing

**Faster healing:**
- Starting exercises early and correctly
- Avoiding harmful exercises
- Addressing other factors (posture, breathing)
- Good nutrition and rest

**Slower healing:**
- Doing traditional ab exercises too soon
- Poor posture habits
- Heavy lifting before ready
- Not engaging pelvic floor

---

## Years Later: Can You Still Heal?

**Yes.** Diastasis can be improved at any point—even years or decades after pregnancy.

Research shows significant improvements in:
- Functional core strength
- Gap closure (some)
- Symptoms like back pain
- Appearance

The approach is the same: build from foundations, progress gradually, avoid harmful exercises.

---

## When to See a Professional

### Consider Seeing a Pelvic Floor PT If:

- Gap is 3+ fingers
- No improvement after 6 weeks of appropriate exercise
- You have pain or symptoms
- You're unsure if you're doing exercises correctly
- You have pelvic floor symptoms (leaking, pressure)

### What They'll Do:

- Assess gap width, depth, and tension
- Evaluate whole-body posture and movement
- Provide personalized exercise progression
- Use hands-on techniques if needed
- Rule out other issues

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I do planks with diastasis recti?

Not traditional planks, initially. Incline planks (hands on wall or counter) are often a good starting point. Progress to lower inclines as your core strengthens.

### Will wearing a binder help?

Abdominal binders can provide support in the early weeks but don't heal diastasis. They may be useful for comfort and proprioception but shouldn't replace exercise.

### Can diastasis recti heal without surgery?

Most cases improve significantly with appropriate exercise. Surgery is rarely necessary and typically considered only after exhausting conservative treatment for functional or medical reasons.

### Will another pregnancy make it worse?

Possibly, but you can prepare: strengthen your core before pregnancy, maintain appropriate exercise during pregnancy, and address any existing diastasis.
