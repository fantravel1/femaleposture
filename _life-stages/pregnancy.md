# Pregnancy Posture: Supporting Your Changing Body

> **Your Body Is Working Hard:** During pregnancy, your center of gravity shifts, hormones loosen ligaments, and your spine adapts to support your growing baby. Understanding these changes helps you stay comfortable and protect your body.

## How Pregnancy Changes Your Posture

### The Physical Shifts

As pregnancy progresses:
- **Center of gravity moves forward** as belly grows
- **Lower back curve increases** (lordosis) to compensate
- **Pelvis tilts forward** (anterior pelvic tilt)
- **Upper back rounds** as breasts enlarge
- **Head moves forward** to balance the changes

### The Hormonal Factor

Relaxin hormone:
- Peaks in the first trimester and before birth
- Loosens all ligaments and joints
- Allows pelvis to widen for delivery
- Can cause joint instability throughout the body
- Means you need extra care with posture and movement

## Common Pregnancy Posture Challenges

### Lower Back Pain

Affects up to 70% of pregnant women:
- Caused by increased lordosis and anterior pelvic tilt
- Worsens as pregnancy progresses
- Often relieved with targeted exercises and support

### Pelvic Girdle Pain

Pain in the front or back of the pelvis:
- May feel like pubic bone pain or SI joint pain
- Can make walking, stairs, and turning in bed difficult
- Responds well to stabilization exercises and support belts

### Upper Back and Neck Pain

Common in later pregnancy:
- Enlarged breasts pull shoulders forward
- Compensatory forward head posture
- Can cause headaches and shoulder tension
