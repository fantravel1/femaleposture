---

## Choosing a Backpack

### Features to Look For

- Padded back panel
- Waist belt (for heavy loads)
- Chest strap
- Multiple compartments

### Proper Size

**Sizing:**

- Not wider than your shoulders
- Bottom sits above waist
- Doesn't extend below hips
- Proportional to your body

---

## Fitting Your Backpack

### Shoulder Straps

**Adjustment:**
- Snug but not tight
- Pack sits high on back
- No gap between pack and back
- Both straps same length
- Comfortable on shoulders

### Waist Belt

**For heavy loads:**
- Sits on hip bones
- Takes weight off shoulders
- Should be snug
- Major weight carrier
- Often underused

### Chest Strap

**Stabilization:**
- Connects shoulder straps
- Keeps straps from slipping
- Shouldn't restrict breathing
- Comfortable position
- Adds stability

---

## Wearing It Right

### Two Straps Always

**Both shoulders:**
- Never one strap
- Weight distributed evenly
- No leaning to one side
- Better posture
- Non-negotiable

### High and Snug

**Position:**
- Pack rides high on back
- Close to body
- Not hanging low
- Not swinging
- Stable position

### Adjust for Load

**When weight changes:**
- Readjust straps
- Tighter for heavier loads
- Check fit regularly
- Different for empty vs. full
- Ongoing adjustment

---

## Packing Strategy

### Weight Distribution

**How to pack:**
- Heaviest items closest to back
- Lighter items toward front
- Centered, not all on one side
- Compact packing
- Strategic placement

### What to Carry

**Minimizing load:**
- Only what's needed that day
- Use locker if available
- Digital options when possible
- Leave some books at school
- Lightest possible load

### Maximum Weight

**Guidelines:**
- No more than 10-15% of body weight
- Less is better
- Heavy is damaging
- Redistribute if possible
- Know the limits

---

## Different Situations

### Long Walks

**Extended carrying:**
- Waist belt essential
- Chest strap engaged
- Lightest possible load
- Posture check-ins
- Breaks if possible

### Stairs

**Extra challenge:**
- Weight feels heavier
- Hold railings
- Take your time
- Be careful
- Balance matters

### Public Transit

**Bus or subway:**
- Remove if crowded
- Hold in lap
- On floor between feet
- Be courteous
- Protect your space

---

## Common Mistakes

- Leads to leaning
- Shoulder strain
- Creates imbalances
- Not cool, actually harmful

### Hanging Too Low

**Problems:**

- Strains lower back
- Throws off posture
- Looks sloppy anyway
- Uncomfortable

### Overpacking

**Too much:**
