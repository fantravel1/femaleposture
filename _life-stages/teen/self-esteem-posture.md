# Teen Self-Esteem and Posture

> **How You Carry Yourself Matters:** Your posture affects how others see you and—maybe more importantly—how you feel about yourself.

---

## The Posture-Confidence Connection

### It Goes Both Ways

**The relationship:**
- How you feel affects how you stand
- How you stand affects how you feel
- This creates feedback loops
- You can use this to your advantage

### What Research Shows

**Studies find:**
- Upright posture linked to better mood
- Confident posture increases confidence feelings
- Slouching associated with lower mood
- Body position affects thoughts

---

## Why Teens Slouch

### Common Reasons

**Many teens slouch because of:**
- Self-consciousness about body
- Wanting to fit in (not stand out)
- Developing breasts
- New height feeling awkward
- Low mood or confidence
- Phone and screen habits
- Tiredness from growth

### It's Understandable

**Adolescence is hard:**
- Body changing constantly
- Comparing to others
- Social pressure intense
- Feeling uncertain
- All of this affects posture

---

## Standing Tall Isn't "Showing Off"

### Reframing Confidence

**Good posture is:**
- Taking care of yourself
- Being present in your body
- Neutral, not aggressive
- Just occupying your space

**It's not:**
- Arrogant or conceited
- Showing off
- Trying to be better than others
- Taking attention from others

### Permission to Take Up Space

**You are allowed to:**
- Stand at your full height
- Have shoulders back
- Look forward, not down
- Be visible

---

## How Posture Affects Others' Perception

### First Impressions

**Body language communicates:**
- Confidence or uncertainty
- Openness or closedness
- Interest or disengagement
- Before you say anything

### In Social Situations

**Standing tall can:**
- Make you seem more confident
- Invite positive interaction
- Create better impressions
- Help in presentations and speaking

### In School

**Posture affects:**
- How teachers perceive you
- Presentation delivery
- Interview success
- General impression

## How Posture Affects How You Feel

### The Mind-Body Connection

**Posture influences:**
- Mood
- Confidence feelings
- Energy level
- Stress response

### Using This To Your Advantage

**Before challenging moments:**
- Stand tall for a few minutes
- Open your chest
- Take up space
- Notice how it feels

## Building Confident Posture

### Start with Awareness

**Notice:**
- When you slouch most
- How different positions feel
- What triggers slouching
- What helps you stand taller

### Small Changes

**Practice:**
- Brief moments of standing tall
- Noticing and adjusting
- Not forcing constantly
- Gradual improvement

### Not Perfection

**Goal is:**
- Comfortable uprightness
- Not rigid military posture
- Sustainable and natural
- Feeling good in your body

---

## Specific Situations

### School Presentations

**Standing tall helps:**
- Voice projects better
- Appear more confident
- Feel more capable
- Better breathing

**Try:**
- Power pose before (private)
- Stand tall as you present
- Eye contact easier from upright position

### Meeting New People

**Confident posture:**
- Creates better first impression
- Makes you seem approachable
- Helps you feel less nervous
- Opens communication

### Photos

**Standing tall in pictures:**
- Look more confident
- Appear more natural
- Like photos better
- Your choice

## When Slouching Is Hiding

### Understanding the Impulse

**You might slouch to:**
- Hide developing body
- Avoid standing out
- Feel smaller/safer
- Match friends' posture

### The Problem

**Chronic slouching:**
- Becomes habit
- Affects how you feel
- Creates physical problems
- Doesn't actually hide you

### Better Strategies

**Instead:**
- Acknowledge the discomfort
- Work on acceptance
- Stand tall anyway (gradual)
- Find supportive community

---

## Beyond Physical Posture

### Internal Confidence

**Also work on:**
- Self-compassion
- Recognizing your worth
- Finding your strengths
- Supportive relationships

### Posture Is Just One Piece

**It helps but:**
- Not magical solution
- Part of overall confidence
- Works with other strategies
- Isn't everything

---

## For Different Body Types

### Tall Teens

**May slouch to:**
- Appear shorter
- Fit in with shorter friends
- Not stand out

**Remember:**
- Your height is yours
- Standing tall is okay
- You don't need to shrink

### Developing Bodies

**All shapes:**
- Deserve to stand tall
- Are worthy of confidence
- Can benefit from good posture
- Don't need to hide

---

## Getting Support

### When Confidence Is Really Low

**Consider talking to:**
- Parent or trusted adult
- School counselor
- Therapist
- Doctor if needed

### Resources

**Available help:**
- School resources
- Teen support groups
- Mental health services
- Books and resources
