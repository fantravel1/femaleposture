# College Tour Posture and Comfort

College tours are exciting but physically demanding—miles of walking across sprawling campuses, standing for information sessions, and navigating unfamiliar terrain. When your feet hurt and you're exhausted, it's hard to focus on whether you actually like the school. Here's how to stay comfortable so you can focus on what matters.

## Walking Demands

### Distance Reality
Campus tours often cover 1-3 miles of walking, sometimes more. Multiply this by visiting multiple schools in a trip, and you're logging serious mileage.

### Terrain Variety
College campuses include hills, stairs, uneven paths, and various surfaces. This is harder than walking on flat surfaces.

### Speed Pressure
Tour guides walk fast. Keeping up while also looking around and listening adds physical challenge.

### Weather Variables
Tours happen in all weather. Hot days, cold days, rainy days—each adds its own physical demand.

## Footwear Priority

### Comfort Over Fashion
This is not the day for cute shoes that hurt after an hour. Choose truly comfortable, supportive shoes you can walk miles in.

### Broken-In Shoes
Don't wear new shoes on tour day. Make sure your footwear is already broken in and proven comfortable.

### Weather-Appropriate
Check the forecast. Waterproof shoes for rain, sandals for heat (if comfortable for walking), layers for variable weather.

### Backup Plan
If doing multiple tours over several days, bring backup shoes in case your primary choice fails you.

## During Tours

### Position in Group
Position yourself where you can see and hear but also stop and rest when needed. Not right at the front where you can't slow down.

### Walking Technique
Walk with good posture—head up, shoulders back—rather than shuffling with head down. This is actually less tiring.

### Stair Management
Use handrails on stairs. Take stairs at your own pace rather than rushing to keep up.

### Photo Breaks
Use photo opportunities as mini-rest breaks. Stop, photograph, catch your breath.

## Information Sessions

### Seating Selection
If given seating choice, select supportive chairs. Auditorium seating is often uncomfortable for extended periods.

### Position Changes
Shift position during long sessions. Cross and uncross legs, adjust sitting position.

### Standing After
After sitting through presentations, stretch briefly before starting walking tours.

## Packing Smart

### Light Bag
Carry a lightweight bag or backpack that distributes weight evenly. Don't load yourself down with heavy materials.

### Water Bottle
Stay hydrated throughout the day. Bring a refillable water bottle.

### Snacks
Energy crashes during tours are distracting. Bring simple snacks for energy maintenance.

### Layers
Dress in layers for variable temperatures between outdoor walking and air-conditioned buildings.

## Multi-School Days

### Realistic Scheduling
Don't schedule too many tours in one day. Two is manageable; three is exhausting.

### Recovery Between
Allow time between schools to sit, eat, and rest before the next tour.

### Prioritizing
If one school matters most to you, save energy for that tour.

### Knowing Limits
It's okay to abbreviate tours or skip portions if you're hitting physical limits.

## After Tours

### Rest Time
After a day of touring, allow genuine rest. Feet up, recovery time before dinner or other activities.

### Stretching
Stretch legs, feet, and back after touring. Release accumulated walking strain.

### Processing Space
Give yourself mental space to think about schools rather than immediately moving to other activities.

## Making Good Decisions

Visiting colleges while physically exhausted and uncomfortable makes it hard to evaluate schools fairly. Protecting your physical comfort isn't just about avoiding sore feet—it's about being in a state where you can make good decisions about an important life choice.
