# Driving Posture for Teens

> **Learning to drive is exciting, but good posture behind the wheel isn't just about comfort—it's about safety and control. Set up your seat correctly every time.**

---

## Why Driving Posture Matters

Proper positioning affects both safety and physical comfort.

### Safety Connections

**Posture affects driving:**
- Reach controls effectively
- React quickly in emergencies
- See clearly in all directions
- Airbag effectiveness
- Vehicle control

### Comfort for Long Drives

**Preventing problems:**
- Back pain on road trips
- Neck strain from poor position
- Fatigue from tension
- Shoulder aches
- Starting habits now

## Seat Adjustment Basics

### Distance from Pedals

**Leg positioning:**
- Reach pedals with slight knee bend
- Not fully extended
- Not cramped against seat
- Test by pressing brake fully
- Comfortable and controlled

### Seat Height

**Optimal elevation:**
- See clearly over wheel
- See hood of car
- Head not hitting roof
- Eye level with top of windshield
- Many cars have height adjustment

### Seat Back Angle

**Recline position:**
- Slight recline (100-110 degrees)
- Not too upright (uncomfortable)
- Not too reclined (compromises control)
- Back fully against seat
- Shoulders touch seatback

### Lumbar Support

**Lower back:**
- Use built-in lumbar if available
- Add small cushion if needed
- Lower back supported
- No gap between back and seat
- Prevents slouching

## Steering Wheel Position

### Height and Reach

**Wheel adjustment:**
- Wrists rest on top of wheel with arms extended
- Slight bend in elbows when gripping
- Not too close (arms cramped)
- Not too far (reaching)
- Test wheel range of motion

### Hand Position

**Where to hold:**
- "9 and 3" position recommended
- Both hands on wheel
- Relaxed grip
- Allows quick maneuvering
- Arms comfortable

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

**What not to do:**

- Arm hanging out window

## Mirror Adjustment

### Why This Matters

**Mirrors and posture:**
- Properly adjusted mirrors require proper posture
- If you slouch, mirrors won't work right
- Posture check every time you look
- Visibility depends on position
- Consistent positioning

### Adjusting Correctly

**Set mirrors with good posture:**
- Sit in driving position first
- Then adjust rearview mirror
- Then side mirrors
- If you can see in mirrors, posture is right
- Re-adjust if needed

## Head and Neck Position

### Headrest Positioning

**Safety essential:**
- Middle of headrest at ear level
- Close to head (2-4 inches)
- Protects neck in collision
- Not too low (dangerous)
- Critical safety feature

### Looking Forward

**Visual positioning:**
- Eyes ahead primarily
- Chin level, not jutting
