# Peer Pressure and Body Language

> **Your body speaks before your words do—learning confident body language helps you stand firm in who you are, even when facing social pressure.**

---

## The Body-Confidence Connection

When you feel pressure to fit in, go along with the crowd, or do something that doesn't feel right, your body language can either make you a target or help you stand your ground.

### How Pressure Affects Posture

**Physical signs of feeling pressured:**
- Shoulders rounding inward protectively
- Eyes looking down to avoid contact
- Arms crossed defensively
- Shifting weight or fidgeting
- Making yourself physically smaller

### Why This Matters

**Body language impacts:**
- How others perceive your confidence
- Whether you become a target for pressure
- Your ability to set and maintain boundaries
- How you feel about yourself
- Your actual confidence level

---

## Building Confident Posture

### Standing Strong

**Physical foundations of confidence:**
- Feet planted shoulder-width apart
- Weight evenly distributed
- Shoulders back and down (not tense)
- Chin level, not tucked or raised
- Arms relaxed at sides or hands on hips

### The Power Pose

**When you need extra confidence:**
- Stand with feet wider than shoulders
- Hands on hips or arms slightly away from body
- Take up more space
- Hold for 2 minutes before challenging situations
- This actually changes your body chemistry

### Eye Contact

**Confident visual connection:**
- Meet eyes briefly when speaking
- Look at eyebrows if direct eye contact is hard
- Don't stare down, but don't avoid either
- Break contact naturally, sideways not down
- Practice with trusted people first

## Body Language for Saying "No"

### Physical "No" Signals

**Reinforce verbal boundaries:**
- Stand tall, don't shrink
- Slight forward lean shows conviction
- Palms out can signal "stop"
- Head shake is clear and universal
- Step back to create physical boundary

### What to Avoid

**Body language that invites push-back:**
- Nervous laughter
- Looking away while speaking
- Covering mouth with hand
- Crossing arms tightly (looks scared)
- Rocking or swaying

### Practice Phrases with Body

**Combine confident posture with words:**
- "No thanks" + slight head shake + maintained eye contact
- "I'm good" + relaxed stance + small smile
- "Not my thing" + shoulder shrug + stepping back
- "I have to go" + turning body toward exit + moving
