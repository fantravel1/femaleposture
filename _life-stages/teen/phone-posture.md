# Phone Posture for Teens: Avoiding Tech Neck

> **Your Neck Carries 10-12 Pounds:** That's your head's weight. Tilt it forward looking at your phone, and the load increases dramatically—up to 60 pounds of strain.

## The Tech Neck Problem

### What's Happening

**When you look down at your phone:**
- Head tilts forward
- Neck bends
- Load on neck multiplies
- Muscles strain

### The Math

**At different angles:**
- Neutral: 10-12 lb load
- 15 degrees: 27 lb
- 30 degrees: 40 lb
- 45 degrees: 49 lb
- 60 degrees: 60 lb
