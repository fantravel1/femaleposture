# Posture and Aging: Maintaining Alignment as You Get Older

> **Age Strong:** Posture changes are not inevitable with aging. With the right approach, you can maintain—or even improve—your posture as you get older.

## How Aging Affects Posture

### Natural Changes

**Spine:**
- Discs lose height and hydration
- Vertebrae may develop bone spurs
- Curves can increase (especially thoracic kyphosis)
- Height decreases

**Muscles:**
- Muscle mass decreases (sarcopenia)
- Strength declines
- Postural muscle endurance affected

**Bones:**
- Bone density decreases
- Osteoporosis risk increases
- Fracture risk rises

**Joints:**
- Cartilage wears
- Stiffness increases
- Range of motion may decrease

### Common Posture Changes

- Increased forward head position
- More rounded upper back (kyphosis)
- Stooped posture
- Height loss
- Balance changes
