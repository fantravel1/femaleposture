## What Is Pregnancy Sciatica?

### The Sciatic Nerve

**Anatomy:**
- Largest nerve in body
- Runs from lower back through buttock
- Down the back of each leg
- When irritated, causes radiating pain

### Why Pregnancy Triggers It

**Contributing factors:**
- Baby's position pressing on nerve
- Weight gain increasing spinal load
- Postural changes from belly growth
- Relaxin hormone loosening joints
- Muscle tension from compensation

**Timing:**
- Most common in third trimester
- Can occur earlier
- May come and go
- Often worse with certain positions

## Positions That Help

### Lying Down
