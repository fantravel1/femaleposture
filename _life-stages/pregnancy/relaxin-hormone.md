# Relaxin Hormone: How It Affects Your Joints During Pregnancy

> **The Hidden Hormone:** Relaxin is a hormone that loosens your ligaments during pregnancy. While necessary for birth, it affects your entire body—and your posture.

---

## What Is Relaxin?

Relaxin is a hormone produced primarily by the ovaries and placenta during pregnancy. Its main job is to:
- Loosen the ligaments of the pelvis
- Relax the cervix
- Prepare the body for childbirth

But relaxin doesn't just affect the pelvis—it affects ligaments throughout your body.

---

## When Does Relaxin Peak?

### Timeline

- **First trimester:** Levels rise quickly, peaking around 14 weeks
- **Second trimester:** Levels plateau but remain elevated
- **Third trimester:** Levels stay high; peak again near delivery
- **Postpartum:** Gradually decreases over weeks to months
- **Breastfeeding:** May remain elevated while nursing

### What This Means

Your joints are most affected:
- Throughout pregnancy
- For several months postpartum
- Potentially longer if breastfeeding

---

## How Relaxin Affects Your Body

### Ligament Laxity

Ligaments normally provide stability to joints. Relaxin makes them more stretchy:
- Joints can move beyond their normal range
- Less stability in all joints
- Increased risk of overstretching

### Joints Most Affected

**Pelvis:**
- SI joints become looser
- Pubic symphysis widens
- Can cause pelvic girdle pain

**Spine:**
- More movement between vertebrae
- Combined with belly weight = posture changes
- Lower back often affected

**Feet:**
- Arches may flatten
- Feet can grow (sometimes permanently)
- Balance affected

**Other joints:**
- Knees may feel less stable
- Wrists can be affected
- Any joint can be impacted

---

## Posture Implications

### How Relaxin Affects Posture

With looser ligaments:
- Your body relies more on muscles for stability
- Standing posture may shift
- Fatigue happens faster
- Old postural habits become more pronounced

### Common Posture Changes

- Increased lower back curve (lordosis)
- Pelvis tips forward (anterior pelvic tilt)
- Shoulders may round more
- Wide-based stance for balance

---

## Managing Relaxin's Effects

### Exercise Considerations

**Do:**
- Strengthening exercises (builds muscle support)
- Low-impact activities
- Stability work
- Swimming (joint-friendly)

**Avoid or modify:**
- Deep stretching (joints already loose)
- High-impact activities
- Exercises that stress joints excessively
- Overstretching in yoga

### Stretching Caution

This is counterintuitive, but:
- You don't need as much stretching during pregnancy
- Ligaments are already loose
- Overstretching can cause injury
- Focus on gentle movement, not deepening flexibility

### Stability Focus

Since ligaments are loose, focus on:
- Core strengthening (safe modifications)
- Hip strengthening (glutes, outer hip)
- Balance exercises
- Pelvic floor work

---

## SI Joint and Pelvic Pain

### Why It Happens

Relaxin particularly affects the SI joints, which can cause:
- One-sided lower back/buttock pain
- Pain with walking or standing on one leg
- Difficulty with stairs
- Pubic symphysis pain (front of pelvis)

### What Helps

- SI support belt
- Gentle stabilization exercises
- Avoiding asymmetric movements
- Physical therapy if needed

---

## Feet Changes

### What Happens

Relaxin combined with weight gain:
- Arches can flatten
- Feet may widen and lengthen
- Changes may be permanent for some women

### What Helps

- Supportive footwear
- Arch support inserts
- Avoid prolonged barefoot on hard surfaces
- Foot-strengthening exercises

---

## Postpartum Considerations

### How Long Does Laxity Last?

- Relaxin decreases after delivery
- Ligaments don't immediately return to pre-pregnancy state
- May take 3-6 months for normalization
- Breastfeeding can prolong effects

### Postpartum Exercise Implications

- Still need to be careful with joint stress
- Progress gradually back to exercise
- Focus on stability before intensity
- High-impact activities may need to wait 4-6 months

---

## Tips for Each Trimester

### First Trimester

- Be aware joints may already feel different
- Continue exercise with modifications
- Avoid overstretching
- Listen to your body

### Second Trimester

- Focus on strengthening over stretching
- Support growing belly
- Wide stance for balance
- Comfortable, supportive shoes

### Third Trimester

- Maximum joint laxity
- Extra careful with balance
- SI belt if needed
- Prepare for postpartum

---

## When to See a Professional

Consult a provider if you experience:
- Significant pelvic or SI pain
- Pain that limits daily activities
- Feeling of instability when walking
- Joint pain that doesn't improve with rest

Physical therapy is often helpful for pregnancy-related joint issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my joints go back to normal after pregnancy?

For most women, yes. Ligaments typically regain most of their pre-pregnancy tension within 3-6 months postpartum. Some women notice lasting changes, especially in feet.

### Can I still do yoga during pregnancy?

Yes, with modifications:
- Avoid deep stretches
- No advanced poses that stress joints
- Prenatal yoga classes are designed for this
- Listen to your body

### Why do my hips pop and crack more during pregnancy?

Loose ligaments allow more joint movement, which can cause popping and cracking sounds. Usually harmless, but mention it to your provider if accompanied by pain.

### Does relaxin affect everyone the same way?

No. Some women notice significant laxity; others barely notice. Genetic factors, previous joint issues, and fitness level all play a role.

### Can I prevent the negative effects of relaxin?

You can't stop relaxin from being released, but you can:
- Strengthen supporting muscles
- Avoid overstretching
- Wear supportive shoes
- Use support belts if needed
