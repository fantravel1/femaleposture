# Hospital Bag Posture Comfort Items

Your hospital bag for labor and delivery should include items that support physical comfort and positioning throughout birth and early postpartum. Hospital supplies cover basics, but personal items that support your body can make a significant difference in comfort and recovery.

## For Labor

### Comfortable Clothing
Loose, easy-to-move-in clothing for early labor. A nightgown or large t-shirt works well. Something you don't mind getting messy.

### Robe for Mobility
A robe allows you to walk halls for movement during labor while maintaining coverage.

### Non-Slip Socks
Hospital floors are slippery. Non-slip socks allow safe movement while keeping feet warm.

### Your Own Pillow
Hospitals provide pillows, but they're often flat and synthetic. Your own pillow supports comfortable positioning and feels familiar.

### Massage Tools
Tennis balls, massage balls, or a back massager for counterpressure during contractions. Lumbar support from massage can be essential.

### Heat Pack
Microwavable or chemical heat packs for lower back pain relief. Check hospital policies on heat sources.

### Focal Point Object
Something to focus on during contractions helps maintain position rather than thrashing. This supports mindful positioning.

## For Labor Positioning

### Birth Ball
Many hospitals have birth balls, but confirm or bring your own if you've practiced with a specific size.

### Positioning Peanut Ball
Peanut-shaped balls support various labor positions. Hospitals may have them, but bringing your own ensures availability.

### Resistance Band
For supported squatting or stretching between contractions. Can be used draped over door or bed rails.

### Cushion or Seat Pad
Extra padding for kneeling positions or sitting on hard surfaces.

## Postpartum Comfort

### Nursing Pillow
Even if hospital provides one, your own nursing pillow you've practiced with supports better early feeding posture.

### Comfortable Going-Home Outfit
Nothing tight. Something that accommodates postpartum body changes and allows comfortable sitting for the ride home.

### Supportive Bra or Nursing Bra
Proper support for potentially engorged breasts. Make sure it's already comfortable, not new and untested.

### Comfortable Underwear
High-waisted underwear that won't press on cesarean incisions and can accommodate large pads.

### Flip Flops for Bathroom
Hospital bathroom floors and showers benefit from easily removed, washable footwear.

## Recovery Support Items

### Belly Support Band
If you have one for post-cesarean or postpartum support, pack it. Hospital staff can help position it.

### Extra Pillows
Additional pillows support nursing positions and side-lying comfort. Small pillows are easier to pack.

### Hot/Cold Packs
For perineal discomfort or breast engorgement. Hospitals may provide some options.

### Stool Softeners
Although hospitals provide these, having your familiar brand can help. Straining to use the bathroom is painful and harmful postpartum.

## Technology for Comfort

### Phone Charger
Long cord that reaches hospital bed. Your phone may provide distraction, timing contractions, and communication.

### Portable Speaker
Music can help with labor focus and relaxation. Check hospital policies.

### Eye Mask
For rest during labor breaks or postpartum naps in bright hospital rooms.

### Earbuds
For personal music or meditation without disturbing others.

## For Your Support Person

### Their Own Pillow and Blanket
Support people need rest too. Hospital sleeping accommodations are minimal.

### Snacks for Them
Labor can be long. Your support person needs to maintain their energy to support you.

### Comfortable Clothes for Them
They may be on their feet for hours, helping you move and position.

## Practical Packing Tips

### Two Bags Approach
One bag for labor (accessible, smaller), one for postpartum (can stay in car until needed).

### Easy Access
Position comfort items at the top of your bag or in outside pockets for easy access.

### Partner Familiarity
Ensure your birth partner knows what's in the bag and where. You won't want to search during contractions.

### Hospital Tour
If possible, tour the hospital beforehand. Know what they provide so you don't overpack or forget essentials.

## What Hospitals Usually Provide

### Typical Inclusions
Most hospitals provide: gowns, mesh underwear, large pads, peri bottles, basic pillows, receiving blankets, diapers, and basic toiletries.

### What Varies
Birth balls, nursing pillows, peanut balls, and specialty positioning items vary by hospital. Ask or bring your own.

### Ask About Policies
Some hospitals have policies about what you can bring (candles usually no, heat packs may vary, electronic policies). Check beforehand.

## Going Home Preparation

### Car Seat
Installed correctly before you arrive at the hospital. Practice with it ahead of time.

### Loose Clothing for Baby
Easy-to-put-on clothes for a newborn who doesn't like being dressed.

### Blanket for Car Seat
For warmth without bulk that affects car seat harness fit.

Your hospital bag should support your physical comfort throughout labor, delivery, and early recovery. Focusing on positioning, support, and comfort items helps your body through this demanding process.
