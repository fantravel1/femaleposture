# Third Trimester Posture Guide

> **Weeks 29-40:** You're in the home stretch. Your belly is at its largest, your body is working its hardest, and posture challenges are at their peak. Here's how to stay as comfortable as possible while preparing for birth.

---

## What's Happening in the Third Trimester

### Physical Changes

Your body is reaching maximum pregnancy adaptation:
- Belly at largest size
- Weight gain peaks (typically total 25-35 lbs)
- Center of gravity significantly forward
- Ribcage expands to accommodate organs
- Breathing capacity reduced (baby pressing on diaphragm)
- Joints at maximum looseness (relaxin peaks)

### Postural Impact

Everything you've experienced is now more pronounced:
- **Maximum lordosis** (lower back curve)
- **Waddling gait** (pelvis rocks side to side)
- **Shortness of breath** (diaphragm compressed)
- **Balance challenges** (center of gravity very forward)
- **Fatigue affecting posture** (hard to maintain alignment)

## Common Third Trimester Issues

### 1. Severe Lower Back Pain

By the third trimester, up to 70% of women experience back pain.

**Why it's worse now:**
- Maximum mechanical stress
- Fatigued muscles
- Maximum ligament laxity
- Sleep disruption affecting recovery

**Management:**
- Prenatal support belt
- Frequent position changes
- Hands-and-knees position for relief
- Pool time (weightlessness helps)
- Prenatal massage
- Physical therapy if severe

### 2. Pelvic Girdle Pain

SI joint and pubic symphysis pain often peak now.

**Signs:**
- Pain in back of pelvis (SI joints)
- Pain at pubic bone
- Clicking or grinding sensation
- Pain with walking, stairs, or rolling in bed
- One-sided activities are difficult

**Management:**
- Keep legs together when moving
- Roll like a log when getting up
- Sit to put on pants/shoes
- SI belt may help
- Avoid asymmetric positions
- Physical therapy

### 3. Rib Pain

As baby grows upward:
- Ribs flare and expand
- Muscles between ribs stretch
- Baby may kick ribs directly

**Management:**
- Side-stretching
- Cat position (hands and knees, round back)
- Encourage baby to move (position changes)
- Hot or cold packs
- Usually resolves when baby drops

### 4. Swelling Affecting Posture

Fluid retention affects:
- Feet (harder to balance)
- Hands (grip changes)
- Legs (changes gait)

**Management:**
- Elevate legs frequently
- Move regularly
- Supportive shoes
- Compression if recommended
- Report sudden significant swelling to provider

## Posture Strategies for Maximum Belly

### Standing

**Realistic approach:**
- Perfect posture is increasingly difficult
- Aim for "good enough"
- Weight on both feet
- Slight knee bend
- Mini-breaks sitting or leaning

**Tips:**
- Avoid prolonged standing
- Have a stool to rest one foot
- Wear supportive shoes
- Lean against wall when possible

### Sitting

**Priorities:**
- Strong lumbar support
- Recline slightly if comfortable
- Feet elevated
- Frequent position changes
- Consider wedge cushion

### Lying Down

**Left side sleeping remains best:**

- Pillow behind back
- May need to be somewhat upright for breathing

**Getting up from lying:**
1. Roll to side
2. Swing legs off bed
3. Push up with arms
4. Never sit straight up

### Walking

**Adaptations:**
- Shorter stride natural and okay
- Wider stance for balance
- Slow down
- Hold handrails
- Wear supportive, flat shoes
