# First Trimester Posture Guide

> **Weeks 1-12:** Your body is already changing, even before you show. Hormones are shifting, fatigue is real, and nausea may be your constant companion. Here's what's happening to your posture and how to take care of yourself.

---

## What's Happening in the First Trimester

### Hormonal Changes

**Relaxin** begins circulating almost immediately:
- Loosens ligaments throughout body
- Prepares pelvis for childbirth
- Affects all joints, not just pelvis
- May cause feeling of instability

**Progesterone** rises dramatically:
- Causes fatigue (protecting the pregnancy)
- Slows digestion
- Relaxes smooth muscles
- Affects breathing patterns

### Physical Changes

While you may not look pregnant yet:
- Breast tissue increases, changing upper body weight
- Blood volume begins increasing
- Fatigue affects how you carry yourself
- Nausea may cause protective postures

---

## Common First Trimester Posture Issues

### 1. Fatigue-Related Slouching

When you're exhausted, good posture takes a back seat.

**What happens:**
- Rounding forward
- Head dropping
- Shoulders slumping
- Core disengaging

**What helps:**
- Rest when needed (this is real, important fatigue)
- Use supportive seating
- Take breaks frequently
- Prioritize sleep

### 2. Nausea Posture

Many women curl protectively when nauseated.

**What happens:**
- Hunching over
- Shallow breathing
- Tension in neck and shoulders
- Protective curling

**What helps:**
- Sit upright when possible (can help nausea)
- Gentle breathing exercises
- Short walks if tolerated
- Don't add guilt—do what you need to

### 3. Breast Tenderness Effects

Significant breast changes begin early.

**What happens:**
- Rounding shoulders to protect chest
- Changes to upper body balance
- Bra support becomes important

**What helps:**
- Supportive bras (sized properly for changes)
- Conscious shoulder positioning
- Chest stretches when comfortable

## Safe Exercises in the First Trimester

Good news: Most exercises remain safe in the first trimester if you were doing them before pregnancy.

### Continue If You Were Already Doing It

- Strength training (with modifications as needed)
- Cardio at your usual level
- Yoga (avoid hot yoga)
- Pilates
- Swimming

### Great First Trimester Exercises

**Cat-Cow:**
- Safe throughout pregnancy
- Gentle spinal mobility
- Good for nausea (gentle movement can help)

**Walking:**
- Helps with energy
- Low-impact
- Can do even when fatigued

**Swimming:**
- Feels wonderful
- Takes pressure off joints
- Maintains fitness

**Gentle Core Work:**
- Dead bugs, bird dogs
- Builds foundation for later
- Stop if any discomfort

### When to Modify

- If exercise worsens nausea
- If you feel faint or dizzy
- If something doesn't feel right
- Listen to your body—it's working hard

## Posture Habits to Establish Now

The first trimester is a good time to build habits that will serve you well as pregnancy progresses.

### Standing Awareness

Practice finding neutral posture now:
- Ears over shoulders
- Shoulders over hips
- Pelvis neutral
- Weight even on both feet

### Sitting Support

Set up your work and home spaces:
- Good lumbar support
- Feet flat on floor
- Monitor at eye level
- Frequent position changes

### Sleep Positioning

No restrictions yet, but start practicing:
- Side sleeping is best later (left side preferred)
- Getting used to pillow between knees
- Building the habit now helps

## Managing Fatigue Without Ruining Posture

### Rest Smart

- Lie down fully rather than slumping on couch
- Supportive pillows when resting
- Short rests are better than powering through

### Prioritize

- This trimester, rest beats exercise
- Skip the workout if you need to
- Your body is growing a human—that's work

### Maintain What You Can

- Even 10 minutes of movement helps
- Stretching counts
- Walking counts
- Something is better than nothing
