# Pregnancy Heartburn: Positions and Posture for Relief

> **When Baby Pushes Up:** Heartburn is extremely common during pregnancy. Your position can make a significant difference in symptoms.

## Why Pregnancy Causes Heartburn

### The Mechanics

**What happens:**
- Growing uterus pushes stomach up
- Hormones relax esophageal sphincter
- Stomach empties more slowly
- Acid moves upward more easily

### When It's Worst

**Common triggers:**
- After eating
- Lying down
- Bending forward
- At night
- Third trimester especially

---

## Posture and Heartburn

### How Position Affects Symptoms

**Standing upright:**
- Gravity keeps acid down
- Better than sitting
- Better than lying

**Slouching:**
- Compresses stomach
- Worsens symptoms
- Common but problematic
