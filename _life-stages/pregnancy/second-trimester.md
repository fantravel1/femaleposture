# Second Trimester Posture Guide

> **Weeks 13-28:** Often called the "golden trimester"—nausea typically fades, energy returns, and you start to show. But with your growing belly comes significant postural changes. Here's how to adapt and stay comfortable.

---

## What's Happening in the Second Trimester

### Physical Changes

Your body is visibly changing:
- Belly grows and protrudes
- Center of gravity shifts forward
- Weight increases (typically 1 lb/week)
- Breasts continue enlarging
- Uterus rises out of pelvis

### Biomechanical Impact

These changes affect how you stand and move:
- **Lumbar lordosis increases** (lower back curve deepens)
- **Thoracic kyphosis may increase** (upper back rounds)
- **Pelvis tilts forward** (anterior tilt)
- **Gait changes** (wider stance, shorter stride)
- **Balance is affected** (center of gravity shifts)

---

## Common Second Trimester Posture Issues

### 1. Increased Lower Back Curve (Lordosis)

**Why it happens:**
- Growing belly pulls pelvis forward
- Back muscles work harder to maintain balance
- Natural compensation for front-loaded weight

**Signs:**
- Lower back fatigue
- Tight hip flexors
- "Sway back" appearance
- Back aching by end of day

**What helps:**
- Pelvic tilts and core engagement
- Glute strengthening
- Hip flexor stretching
- Supportive footwear

### 2. Round Ligament Pain

**Why it happens:**
- Ligaments supporting uterus stretch
- More common with position changes
- Sharp, sudden pain typically

**Signs:**
- Sharp pain in lower abdomen/groin
- Triggered by quick movements
- Usually one-sided

**What helps:**
- Move more slowly
- Support belly when changing positions
- Gentle stretching
- Prenatal support belt

### 3. Upper Back and Shoulder Tension

**Why it happens:**
- Breast changes affect upper body
- Compensating for shifted center of gravity
- Fatigue from maintaining posture

**Signs:**
- Tension between shoulder blades
- Rounded shoulders
- Neck stiffness
- Headaches

**What helps:**
- Supportive bra
- Regular stretching
- Good ergonomics at desk
- Prenatal massage

## Posture Adjustments for the Second Trimester

### Standing Posture

**Ideal position:**
- Feet hip-width apart or slightly wider
- Weight even on both feet
- Slight knee bend (not locked)
- Pelvis neutral (resist excessive tilt)
- Ribs over pelvis
- Shoulders relaxed
- Head balanced over shoulders

**Common mistakes:**
- Locking knees
- Hip-popping to one side
- Arching back excessively
- Leaning backward

### Sitting Posture

**Key adjustments:**
- Lumbar support is essential
- Sit fully back in chair
- Feet flat on floor or footrest
- Knees at hip level or slightly below
- Frequent position changes
- Stand every 30 minutes if possible

### Sleeping Posture

**Recommended: Left side sleeping**
- Improves blood flow to uterus
- Pillow between knees
- Pillow under belly
- Pillow behind back to prevent rolling

**Avoid:**
- Back sleeping (uterus can compress blood vessels)
- Stomach sleeping (uncomfortable and pressures belly)

## Safe Exercises for the Second Trimester

### Core Work (Modified)

Traditional crunches are out, but core work continues:

**Pelvic Tilts:**
1. Can be done standing, sitting, or hands-and-knees
2. Tuck tailbone under
3. Gentle engagement
4. Great for lower back relief

**Bird Dog:**
1. Hands and knees
2. Extend opposite arm and leg
3. Keep spine neutral
4. Builds core stability

**Side-Lying Core Work:**
1. Avoids back position
2. Side-lying leg lifts
3. Clamshells
4. Maintains hip and core strength

### Stretching

**Cat-Cow:**
- Excellent for spinal mobility
- Relieves back tension
- Safe throughout pregnancy

**Hip Flexor Stretches:**
- Counter tight hip flexors from anterior tilt
- Half-kneeling stretch
- Support with pillows as needed

**Chest Stretches:**
- Doorway stretch
- Opens rounded shoulders
- Helps with breathing

### Cardio

Continue or start appropriate cardio:
- Walking
- Swimming (wonderful for pregnancy)
- Stationary bike
- Prenatal dance or aerobics
- Modified hiking

## Preparing for the Third Trimester

### What's Coming

- Belly continues growing significantly
- More pronounced postural shifts
- Breathing may become more difficult
- Sleep challenges increase
- Fatigue often returns

### What to Do Now

1. **Build habits** — Good posture and exercise routines
2. **Strengthen** — Glutes, core, and back while it's easier
3. **Set up support** — Pillows, belt, workspace adjustments
4. **Address issues** — Don't wait for pain to worsen

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Significant changes are happening** — Your body is adapting to major shifts in weight distribution

2. **Lower back curve increases naturally** — Counter with core engagement and glute strength

3. **Keep moving** — Exercise helps more than it hurts (with appropriate modifications)

4. **Side sleeping becomes important** — Left side preferred for circulation
