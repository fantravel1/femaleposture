# Diastasis Recti Prevention During Pregnancy

> **Protecting Your Core:** Some abdominal separation is normal during pregnancy, but you can minimize it with awareness and safe techniques.

---

## Understanding Diastasis Recti

### What It Is

**Diastasis recti:**
- Separation of rectus abdominis muscles
- The "six-pack" muscles move apart
- Connective tissue stretches
- Normal to some degree in pregnancy

### Why It Happens

**Contributing factors:**
- Growing uterus pushes out
- Hormones soften connective tissue
- Multiple pregnancies
- Large babies
- Weak core before pregnancy
- Certain movement patterns

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Core Awareness

**Throughout pregnancy:**
- Learn to engage core safely
- Avoid straining
- Support movements
- Proper breathing

### What to Avoid

**Movements that worsen separation:**
- Traditional crunches/sit-ups
- Twisting with load
- Heavy lifting with poor form
- Jackknife movements
- Pushing through midline

### What to Do Instead

**Safe core work:**
- Transverse abdominis engagement
- Pelvic floor connection
- Supported movements
- Proper mechanics

---

## Safe Core Exercises

### Transverse Abdominis Activation

**The deep core:**
- Draw belly button toward spine gently
- Like hugging baby with muscles
- Don't hold breath
- Practice regularly

### Modified Exercises

**Safe options:**
- Bird dog (on hands and knees)
- Side planks (modified)
- Pelvic tilts
- Kegels with core engagement

### What Not to Do

**Avoid:**
- Front planks (later pregnancy)
- Any exercise that causes doming
- Pushing through pain
- Straining

---

## Daily Movement Modifications

### Getting Up from Bed

**Safe technique:**
- Roll to side first
- Use arms to push up
- Don't jackknife forward
- Engage core

### Lifting

**Proper form:**
- Bend knees, not waist
- Engage core before lifting
- Exhale on effort
- Avoid heavy loads

### Coughing and Sneezing

**Protect your abs:**
- Bend knees slightly
- Support belly with hands if needed
- Turn head to side
- Engage pelvic floor

---

## Checking for Separation

### How to Check

**Self-assessment:**
- Lie on back (early pregnancy only)
- Knees bent, feet flat
- Lift head slightly
- Feel for gap above/below navel

**What you're feeling for:**
- Width of gap (finger widths)
- Depth (how deep fingers sink)
- Any doming or bulging

### When to Consult Professional

**Seek guidance if:**
- Gap is more than 2 fingers wide
- Visible doming with movements
- Difficulty engaging core
- Lower back pain

---

## Exercise Progression

**Focus on:**
- Core awareness
- Good habits
- Safe exercises
- Posture

### Second Trimester

**Modifications:**
- Avoid lying flat on back
- Modify exercises as needed
- Continue core work safely
- Watch for doming

### Third Trimester
