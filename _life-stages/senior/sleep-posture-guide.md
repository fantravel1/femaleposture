# Sleep Posture Guide for Seniors

> **Quality sleep becomes increasingly important as we age, and how you position yourself for sleep can mean the difference between waking rested or achy. The right setup supports both comfort and safety.**

## Why Sleep Posture Matters More Now

Age-related changes make sleep positioning more important.

### Physical Considerations

**What changes:**

### Sleep Quality Impact

**Good positioning helps:**
- Reduce morning stiffness
- Prevent pain
- Support breathing
- Improve overall sleep quality
- Wake more refreshed

## Recommended Sleep Positions

### Side-Lying

**Often the best choice:**
- Spine naturally aligned
- Pillow between knees essential
- Pillow under head supporting neck
- Body pillow helpful for support
- Alternate sides to prevent imbalance

### Back Sleeping

**For some conditions:**
- May be preferred for back issues
- Pillow under knees reduces pressure
- Proper pillow height for neck
- Not good for sleep apnea
- Keep neutral spine

### What to Avoid

**Positions that cause problems:**
- Stomach sleeping (neck strain)
- Twisted positions
- Arms overhead (circulation)
- Neck too flexed or extended
- Any position causing numbness

## Pillow Support

### Head Pillow

**Proper support:**
- Height that keeps neck neutral
- Not too high (bends neck forward)
- Not too low (bends neck back)
- May need different pillow as aging progresses
- Replace worn pillows

### Knee Pillow

**For side sleeping:**
- Between knees when on side
- Under knees when on back
- Keeps hips aligned
- Reduces lower back pressure
- Can be small pillow or wedge

### Body Pillow

**Full-length support:**
- Helpful for side sleepers
- Provides something to hold
- Supports top leg and arm
- Prevents rolling to stomach
- Increases comfort

## Mattress Considerations

### Choosing a Mattress

**What to look for:**
- Medium-firm often best
- Supportive but not too hard
- Pressure relief at hips and shoulders
- Good edge support for getting up
- Personal preference matters

### Mattress Toppers

**Quick improvements:**
- Can improve comfort of existing mattress
- Various firmness options
- Less expensive than new mattress
- Memory foam or latex options
- May help with pressure points

## Getting In and Out of Bed Safely

### Safer Rising

**Morning routine:**
- Don't jump up quickly
- Roll to side first
- Push up to sitting with arms
- Sit on bed edge for moment
- Stand slowly using legs

### Lying Down

**Reverse the process:**
- Sit on bed edge
- Lower to side position
- Roll to back or stay on side
- Adjust pillows as needed
- Controlled movement
