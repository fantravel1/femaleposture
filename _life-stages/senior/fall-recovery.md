# Fall Recovery for Senior Women

Falls happen, even with the best prevention efforts. Knowing what to do after a fall—whether to get up yourself, how to get up safely, and when to seek help—is essential knowledge for older women. How you respond in the moments and hours after a fall significantly affects outcomes.

## Immediately After a Fall

### Stay Calm
Panic increases injury risk and impairs judgment. Take a moment to calm yourself before moving.

### Don't Rush to Rise
The instinct is to get up immediately. Resist this—assess yourself first while still on the ground.

### Check for Pain
Without moving much, notice where you hurt. Severe pain, especially in hip, back, or head, warrants caution.

### Move Slowly
Gently move your hands, arms, legs, and feet. Note any pain with movement.

### Assess the Situation
Are you somewhere safe? Is help available? Do you have a phone or medical alert device?

## If You Think You're Injured

### Don't Try to Get Up
If you suspect a fracture or serious injury, stay where you are and call for help.

### Call for Help
Use a phone or medical alert device. If you don't have one, call out for help.

### Keep Warm
If you must wait, use whatever is available to stay warm—a coat, blanket, or even newspaper.

### Stay Calm
Help will come. Panic doesn't help and may worsen injury.

## If You Can Get Up Safely

### The Recommended Method
1. Roll onto your side
2. Push yourself up onto your hands and knees
3. Crawl to a sturdy piece of furniture
4. Place hands on the furniture seat
5. Bring one foot forward, placing it flat on the floor
6. Push up using your arms and front leg
7. Turn and sit on the furniture to rest

### Using Furniture
A sturdy chair, coffee table, or couch provides the support needed. Don't try to rise from the floor without something to hold onto.

### Take Your Time
There's no rush. Each step should be done carefully and completely before moving to the next.

### Rest After Rising
Sit and rest after getting up. Assess how you feel before walking anywhere.

## After You're Up

### Check for Injuries
Look for cuts, bruises, or swelling. Some injuries aren't immediately apparent.

### Apply Ice If Needed
For bumps and bruises, ice can reduce swelling. 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off.

### Monitor for Problems
Some injuries, especially internal or head injuries, show symptoms hours later. Monitor yourself.

### Tell Someone
Tell a family member, friend, or neighbor about the fall, even if you feel fine.

## When to Seek Medical Attention

### Go Immediately If
- You hit your head
- You can't get up or walk normally
- You have severe pain anywhere
- You feel confused or drowsy
- You're on blood thinners (increased bleeding risk)
- You have significant swelling

### Watch for Later Symptoms
- Worsening pain
- Increased swelling or bruising
- Dizziness or confusion
- Unusual fatigue
- Difficulty with normal activities

### Don't Minimize
Many older women downplay falls. This can miss serious injuries. When in doubt, get checked.

## Preparing for Potential Falls

### Medical Alert Devices
Wearable alert devices ensure you can call for help if you fall and can't reach a phone.

### Phone Accessibility
Keep phones charged and accessible. Consider a phone in each room you use regularly.

### Getting Up Practice
When you're well, practice the floor-to-furniture-to-standing technique. Knowing how to get up makes actual falls less frightening.

### Telling Others
Let family and friends know if you've fallen, even without injury. Patterns of falling need attention.

## After a Fall: Prevention Focus

### Review What Happened
Understanding why you fell helps prevent future falls. What were you doing? What contributed?

### Address Contributing Factors
Fix hazards, improve lighting, remove tripping risks, review medications, and address vision or balance issues.

### Consider Physical Therapy
PT can address balance and strength deficits identified by falls. Falling is a signal that intervention may help.

### Don't Fear Movement
Fear of falling can lead to reduced activity, which actually increases fall risk. Stay active with appropriate precautions.

## Emotional Recovery

### Falls Are Distressing
Falling can shake confidence and create fear. These feelings are normal.

### Processing the Experience
Talk about the fall with someone you trust. Processing the experience helps.

### Restoring Confidence
Gradually return to normal activities. Excessive fear-based restriction isn't the answer.

### Seeking Support
If fear of falling significantly affects your life, discuss with healthcare providers or mental health support.

Falls don't have to be catastrophic events. Knowing how to respond—staying calm, assessing injury, getting up safely, and seeking appropriate help—improves outcomes and supports continued confidence and independence.
