# Downsizing and Home Ergonomics for Seniors

Moving to a smaller home or reorganizing your current space for aging in place requires thoughtful attention to ergonomics. The furniture and layout that worked when you were younger may not support your current needs. Downsizing offers an opportunity to create a home environment that protects your body and supports independence.

## The Downsizing Opportunity

### Fresh Start
Moving allows you to set up space optimally from the beginning.

### Keeping What Works
Keep furniture that supports good posture; release what doesn't.

### Right-Sizing
A smaller, well-organized space can be easier to maintain.

### Accessibility Focus
New spaces can be designed with accessibility in mind.

## Furniture Selection

### Chair Quality
Keep or acquire chairs that support sitting down, getting up, and prolonged sitting.

### Bed Height
Beds should be high enough to get into and out of easily.

### Table Heights
Dining and work tables should allow comfortable seated posture.

### Couch Considerations
Avoid couches that are too deep or low—they're hard to rise from.

## Kitchen Ergonomics

### Counter Heights
Standard counter heights may not be optimal. Assess your needs.

### Frequently Used Items
Keep everyday items between waist and shoulder height.

### Step Stool Safety
If you need a step stool, choose a sturdy one with handrail.

### Chair Access
A chair in the kitchen allows seated food preparation when needed.

## Bathroom Safety

### Grab Bars
Install grab bars near toilet and in shower/tub.

### Non-Slip Surfaces
Use non-slip mats and consider non-slip flooring.

### Toilet Height
Raised toilet seats or comfort-height toilets are easier to use.

### Shower Seating
A shower seat or bench allows safe, seated bathing.

## Bedroom Setup

### Bed Accessibility
Ensure clear paths to and from bed.

### Nightstand Reach
Keep essentials within easy reach from bed.

### Lighting
Good lighting prevents falls during night waking.

### Emergency Access
Phone or emergency button should be accessible from bed.

## Living Space Layout

### Clear Pathways
Wide, clear paths reduce fall risk.

### Furniture Spacing
Space furniture for easy navigation, not cramped arrangement.

### Lighting Quality
Good lighting throughout prevents accidents.

### Cord Management
Eliminate trip hazards from electrical cords.

## Organization Strategies

### Vertical Storage
Items stored too high or too low require unsafe reaching or bending.

### Labeling
Clear labeling reduces searching and frustration.

### Decluttering
Less stuff means fewer obstacles and easier cleaning.

### Accessibility Priority
Most-used items should be most accessible.

## Technology Integration

### Smart Home Features
Voice-controlled lights, thermostats, and locks reduce physical demands.

### Medical Alerts
Personal emergency response systems provide safety.

### Video Communication
Technology for staying connected without travel.

### Simplified Devices
Use technology that's easy to operate without straining.

## Moving Process

### Professional Help
Hire movers rather than lifting and carrying yourself.

### Supervised Unpacking
Direct unpacking rather than doing it yourself.

### Gradual Setup
Take time to set up space thoughtfully rather than rushing.

### Adjustment Period
Give yourself time to arrange and rearrange as you learn the space.

## If Staying in Current Home

### Assessment
Evaluate current home for accessibility and ergonomics.

### Modifications
Make modifications for safety and comfort.

### Decluttering
Remove unnecessary items that create obstacles.

### Professional Consultation
Occupational therapists can assess and recommend modifications.

## Choosing New Housing

### Single Floor
One-story living eliminates stair challenges.

### Accessibility Features
Look for existing accessibility features.

### Modification Potential
Consider what modifications are possible.

### Community Resources
Proximity to services reduces travel demands.

## Planning Ahead

### Future Needs
Consider not just current but anticipated future needs.

### Flexibility
Choose setup that can adapt as needs change.

### Safety Priority
Prioritize safety even over aesthetics.

### Support Network
Consider proximity to family or community support.

Your home should support your well-being and independence. Whether downsizing or modifying your current space, thoughtful attention to ergonomics creates an environment that protects your body and enhances your quality of life.
