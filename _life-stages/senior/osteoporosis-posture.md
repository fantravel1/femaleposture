# Osteoporosis and Posture

> **Strong Posture, Fragile Bones:** With osteoporosis, posture matters more than ever—but you need safe approaches. Here's how to maintain upright posture while protecting your spine.

---

## Why Posture Matters More with Osteoporosis

### The Risk

**Poor posture with osteoporosis:**
- Increases fracture risk
- Worsens kyphosis
- Creates unsafe loads on spine
- Forward bending most risky

### The Opportunity

**Good posture:**
- Reduces fracture risk
- Prevents worsening curves
- Maintains function
- Preserves independence

---

## Understanding the Risks

### Vertebral Fractures

**Most common osteoporotic fracture:**
- Spine vertebrae collapse
- Can happen without trauma
- Cause increased kyphosis
- Often go undiagnosed initially

### How They Happen

**Risk activities:**
- Forward bending with load
- Twisting movements
- Heavy lifting
- Falls
- Sometimes just sneezing

---

## Movements to Avoid

### High-Risk Movements

**Do NOT do:**
- Toe touches (standing or seated)
- Sit-ups or crunches
- Loaded forward bending
- Heavy lifting
- Twisting under load
- High-impact jumping

### Why These Are Dangerous

**Forward flexion:**
- Compresses front of vertebrae
- Where bone is weakest
- Can cause compression fractures
- Even with moderate load

---

## Safe Posture Principles

### Spine Neutral or Extended

**Keep spine:**
- In neutral alignment
- Slightly extended is okay
- Never flexed under load
- Protected in all activities

### Hip Hinge, Not Spine Bend

**For reaching low:**
- Bend at hips
- Keep back straight
- Squat if needed
- Never round spine forward

### Avoid Twisting Under Load

**When turning:**
- Move feet first
- Don't twist spine
- Especially with weight

---

## Safe Exercises

### Back Extension

**Strengthening extensors:**
- Prone back extensions (gentle)
- Standing back extension
- Strengthens postural muscles
- Safe direction for spine

### Core Work (Modified)

**Safe options:**
- Planks (modified)
- Bird dogs
- Bridges
- Pelvic tilts
- NO crunches or sit-ups

### Strength Training

**Safe approach:**
- Can and should strength train
- Proper form essential
- Avoid loaded flexion
- Machines may be safer
- Professional guidance recommended

### Balance Work

**Important for fall prevention:**
- All balance exercises
- Reduces fall risk
- Prevents fractures
- See [Falls Prevention](/life-stages/senior/falls-prevention/)

## Daily Activities

### Getting Out of Bed

**Safe technique:**
- Roll to side first
- Push up with arms
- Don't sit straight up (crunching)
- Legs off bed, push to sitting

### Picking Things Up

**From floor:**
- Squat or golfer's pickup
- Keep back straight
- Never bend at waist
- Ask for help with heavy items

### Household Tasks

**Modifications:**
- Long-handled tools
- Avoid heavy lifting
- Break tasks into smaller parts
- Ask for help when needed

### Gardening

**Safe approach:**
- Raised beds when possible
- Kneeling instead of bending
- Light loads only
- See [Gardening Guide](/activities/gardening/)

## Posture for Kyphosis Prevention

### Why It Matters

**Vertebral fractures cause:**
- Increased forward curve
- Shortened height
- Breathing restriction
- Continued risk

### Prevention Focus
