# Church and Worship Service Comfort for Seniors

Religious services and worship activities are important to many older women, providing spiritual sustenance and community connection. However, services often involve extended sitting on pews or chairs not designed for aging bodies, standing and sitting repeatedly, and potentially kneeling. Managing physical comfort during worship allows you to focus on the spiritual experience.

## Pew and Seating Challenges

Seating heights may not suit your body.

Close seating limits position adjustments.

## Comfort Strategies

Bring a seat cushion for hard pews.

Small lumbar pillow or rolled jacket for back support.

### Strategic Seating
Choose seats with more room or better support.

### Aisle Access
Sit near aisles for easier exit if needed.

## Standing and Sitting Transitions
