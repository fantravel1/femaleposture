- Compensating positions

### Problems with Compensation

**Strain from:**
- Constant head turning
- Neck strain
- Asymmetric positioning
- Muscle tension
- Postural changes

---

## Balance Considerations

### Falls and Hearing

**Research shows:**
- Hearing loss increases fall risk
- Not just ear balance
- Cognitive load
- Environmental awareness
- Multiple factors
