# Postpartum Posture Recovery: Rebuilding Your Body

> **Healing Takes Time:** Your body spent nine months transforming for pregnancy. It needs patience and proper progression to recover. Rushing back to "normal" can cause problems; thoughtful rebuilding creates lasting strength.

## What Happens to Your Body Postpartum

### The Physical Changes

After birth, your body is:
- **Recovering from stretched abdominal muscles** (often with separation)
- **Dealing with lingering joint laxity** from relaxin
- **Adapting to new demands:** Feeding, lifting, carrying baby
- **Healing** from the physical process of birth

### Why Posture Often Gets Worse

New mothers face:
- **Hours in forward positions** for breastfeeding/bottle feeding
- **Constant lifting and carrying** of baby and equipment
- **Sleep deprivation** that affects muscle control
- **Weak core** that can't support good posture yet

---

## Common Postpartum Posture Issues

### 1. Diastasis Recti

Abdominal muscle separation:
- Affects 60%+ of women postpartum
- Creates weak core foundation
- Requires specific rehabilitation approach
- Most cases improve significantly with proper exercise

### 2. Forward Head and Rounded Shoulders

From feeding and baby care:
- Looking down at baby for hours daily
- Carrying car seat, diaper bag, baby
- Hunched feeding positions
- Pushchair/stroller pushing

### 3. Pelvic Floor Weakness

Affects posture because:
- Pelvic floor is part of core system
- Weak floor = weak foundation
- Can cause compensatory patterns
- Often coexists with diastasis

### 4. Lower Back Pain

Often worse than during pregnancy:
- Core still weakened
- Heavy lifting (baby, car seat)
- Awkward positions for feeding and care
- Sleep deprivation affects muscle function

## Safe Postpartum Exercise Progression

### Weeks 1-2 (Immediate Postpartum)

**Focus on:** Breathing, gentle connection

- **Diaphragmatic breathing:** Re-establish core-breath connection
- **Gentle pelvic floor activation:** If comfortable
- **Short walks:** As tolerated
- **Rest:** Essential for healing

### Weeks 2-6

**Focus on:** Gentle activation, not strengthening

- **Core connection breathing:** Exhale with gentle ab engagement
- **Heel slides:** Low-load core work
- **Pelvic tilts:** Gentle movement
- **Glute bridges:** Gentle squeezes
- **Walking:** Gradually increase duration

### Weeks 6-12

**Focus on:** Rebuilding foundation

- **Modified dead bug:** Arms or legs only, then progress
- **Bird dog:** On hands and knees
- **Supported squats:** With good form
- **Wall push-ups:** Upper body work
- **Core exercises:** Progressing based on diastasis healing

### 3+ Months

**Focus on:** Progressive strengthening

- Progress exercises as strength builds
- May begin higher-intensity exercise if cleared
- Address any remaining diastasis
- Focus on exercises that counteract daily postures

---

## Breastfeeding Posture

### Setting Up for Success

Good feeding posture matters because you'll spend 8+ hours daily in this position.

**Essentials:**
- Support your back (pillows, nursing pillow, footstool)
- Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby
- Keep shoulders back, not hunched
- Use pillows to support baby's weight
- Alternate positions (cradle, football, side-lying)

### After Each Feed

Take 30 seconds to:
- Roll shoulders back
- Do 3-5 chin tucks
- Stretch chest in doorway
- Stand tall and walk around

---

## Baby Care Posture

### Lifting Baby

- Bend at knees, not waist
- Hold baby close to body
- Engage core before lifting
- Avoid twisting while carrying

### Carrying Baby

- Switch sides frequently
- Use a supportive carrier
- Maintain upright posture
- Avoid hip-popping to one side

### Diaper Changes and Bathing

- Adjust table/surface to waist height
- Don't hunch over low surfaces
- Keep frequently-used items within reach
- Consider kneeling instead of bending

### Stroller/Pushchair Use

- Keep arms relaxed, elbows slightly bent
- Walk tall, don't lean into the handle
- Adjust handle height if possible
- Take breaks from pushing

## When to Seek Help

### Red Flags

See a pelvic floor PT if you have:
- Visible doming/bulging in abdomen
- Leaking urine (stress incontinence)
- Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms
- Pain during exercise
- Diastasis not improving by 8-12 weeks

### Professional Support

Consider help from:
- **Pelvic floor physical therapist:** Core and pelvic floor rehabilitation
- **Postpartum fitness specialist:** Safe exercise progression
- **Lactation consultant:** Optimal feeding positions
- **Doctor/midwife:** Overall health and clearance
