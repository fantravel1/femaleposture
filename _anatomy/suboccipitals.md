# Suboccipital Muscles

The suboccipitals are four small muscles at the base of the skull. Despite their size, they have significant effects on head position, neck pain, and headaches.

## Anatomy

### Four Muscles

**1. Rectus Capitis Posterior Major**
- C2 to occiput
- Extension and rotation

**2. Rectus Capitis Posterior Minor**
- C1 to occiput
- Extension

**3. Obliquus Capitis Superior**
- C1 to occiput
- Side bending and rotation

**4. Obliquus Capitis Inferior**
- C2 to C1
- Rotation

### Location

**Deep at skull base:**
- Beneath larger neck muscles
- Behind mastoid process
- Critical area for function

## Function

### Fine Head Control

**Precision movements:**
- Small adjustments of head
- Eye-head coordination
- Balance information

### Proprioception

**Rich in sensors:**
- More spindles than any muscle
- Feed positioning information
- Important for balance

## Problems

### Overwork

**Causes:**
- Forward head posture
- Computer use
- Phone looking down
- Stress

**Results:**
- Tension at skull base
- Cervicogenic headaches
- Neck stiffness
- Eye strain

### Trigger Points

**Common sites:**
- Refer pain to head
- Cause headaches
- Contribute to migraines

## Relief

### Self-Release

**Tennis ball technique:**
1. Lie on back
2. Ball at skull base
3. Gentle pressure
4. Small movements

### Stretching

**Chin tucks:**
- Lengthens suboccipitals
- Restores position
- Regular practice needed

## Prevention

- Ergonomic setup
- Regular breaks
- Chin tuck exercises
- Posture awareness
