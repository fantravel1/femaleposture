# Deep Hip Rotators

The deep hip rotators, often called the "deep six," are small but important muscles deep within the buttock that control hip rotation and provide stability.

## The Deep Six

### 1. Piriformis

**Most well-known:**
- Sciatic nerve runs near/through it
- External rotator
- Becomes internal rotator when hip flexed

### 2. Obturator Internus

- Lines inner pelvis
- Turns at ischium
- External rotation

### 3. Obturator Externus

- Deep muscle
- External rotation

### 4. Superior Gemellus

- Above obturator internus tendon
- Assists obturator internus

### 5. Inferior Gemellus

- Below obturator internus tendon
- Assists obturator internus

### 6. Quadratus Femoris

- Most inferior
- Square-shaped
- Powerful external rotator

## Function

### Primary Role

**External rotation:**
- Turn thigh outward
- Essential for many movements
- Walking, turning, dancing

### Stability

**Hip joint stability:**
- Compress femoral head
- Control rotation
- Provide proprioception

### Position-Dependent

**When hip flexed:**
- Some become internal rotators
- Piriformis notably

## Piriformis Syndrome

### What Happens

- Piriformis irritates sciatic nerve
- Pain in buttock
- May radiate down leg
- Mimics sciatica

### Causes

- Prolonged sitting
- Hip weakness
- Overuse
- Trauma

### Management

- Stretching
- Strengthening glutes
- Avoid prolonged sitting
- Address underlying cause

## Common Patterns

### Tightness

**External rotator tightness:**
- Common in cross-legged sitters
- Limits internal rotation
- May cause hip impingement

### Weakness

**Effects:**
- Poor hip control
- Compensation patterns
- May contribute to hip pain

## Exercises

### Stretching

- Figure-4 stretch
- Pigeon pose
- Seated rotation stretch
- Supine rotation

### Strengthening

- Clamshells
- Side-lying rotation
- Fire hydrants
- Single-leg exercises
