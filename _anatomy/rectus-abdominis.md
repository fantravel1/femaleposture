# Rectus Abdominis

The rectus abdominis is the most superficial abdominal muscle, visible as the "six-pack." While it gets the most attention, it's NOT the primary core stabilizer.

## Anatomy

### Structure

**Two parallel strips:**
- Run vertically
- Separated by linea alba
- "Six-pack" appearance from tendinous intersections

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Pubic crest
- Pubic symphysis

**Insertion:**
- Xiphoid process
- Costal cartilages (ribs 5-7)

## Function

### Primary Action

**Trunk flexion:**
- Crunching motion
- Curling torso toward pelvis
- Sit-up movement

### Secondary Roles

**Postural:**
- Resists extension forces
- Compression of abdomen
- Forced exhalation

## Reality Check

### Not the Primary Stabilizer

**Common misconception:**
- Six-pack ≠ strong core
- Rectus = movement muscle
- TrA = stability muscle

### Overemphasis

**Problems with too much focus:**
- Neglects deep core
- May increase pelvic pressure
- Doesn't fix posture
- Can worsen diastasis

## Diastasis Recti

### What Happens

**Separation:**
- Linea alba stretches
- Muscles separate
- Common in pregnancy

### Proper Recovery

- Focus on deep core first
- Avoid crunches initially
- Build coordination
- See specialist if needed

## Exercises

### When Appropriate

**After core foundation:**
- Planks
- Dead bugs
- Rollouts
- Hanging leg raises

### Not Recommended

**For posture improvement:**
- Endless crunches
- Sit-ups
- Don't prioritize six-pack for function
