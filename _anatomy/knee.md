# Knee Anatomy

The knee is the largest joint in the body, bearing significant load during daily activities. Knee alignment is heavily influenced by the hip and ankle, making it a common site of compensation.

## Joint Structure

### Bones

**Three bones form the knee:**
1. Femur (thigh bone)
2. Tibia (shin bone)
3. Patella (kneecap)

### Cartilage

**Menisci:**
- Medial meniscus (inner)
- Lateral meniscus (outer)
- Shock absorbers
- Improve joint congruence

**Articular cartilage:**
- Covers bone surfaces
- Allows smooth gliding
- Vulnerable to wear

### Ligaments

**Cruciate ligaments (inside):**
- ACL: Prevents forward tibial movement
- PCL: Prevents backward tibial movement

**Collateral ligaments (sides):**
- MCL: Inner knee stability
- LCL: Outer knee stability

## Movements

### Flexion and Extension

- Primary movements
- Hinge joint motion
- Full range important

### Rotation

- Small amount when bent
- Important for normal function
- Screw-home mechanism

## Women's Considerations

### Q-Angle

**Quadriceps angle:**
- Line from hip to kneecap to tibia
- Typically greater in women
- Due to wider pelvis

**Implications:**
- Different force vectors
- Patellar tracking issues
- Valgus tendency (knock-knee)
- ACL injury risk

### Ligament Laxity

**Hormonal influences:**
- Estrogen affects ligaments
- Varies with menstrual cycle
- May increase injury risk

## Common Issues

### Patellofemoral Pain

- Kneecap tracking issues
- Common in women
- Often related to hip weakness
- Responds to strengthening

### ACL Injuries

- Women 4-6x higher risk
- Landing mechanics important
- Prevention programs effective
- Neuromuscular training helps

### Knee Valgus

- Knees collapse inward
- Related to hip weakness
- Common compensation
- Address at hip level

## Posture Connections

### Knee Position

**Hyperextension:**
- Standing with locked knees
- Pushes pelvis forward
- Often with anterior tilt

**Proper alignment:**
- Soft knees
- Weight distributed
- Tracking over toes
