# Quadriceps Muscles

The quadriceps are the four muscles on the front of the thigh responsible for knee extension. Their balance with hip flexors and hamstrings significantly affects pelvic posture.

## Anatomy

### The Four Muscles

**1. Rectus Femoris**
- Only quad crossing hip AND knee
- Hip flexion and knee extension
- Most superficial (visible)

**2. Vastus Lateralis**
- Largest quad muscle
- Outer thigh
- Knee extension only

**3. Vastus Medialis**
- Inner thigh (VMO near knee)
- Important for kneecap tracking
- Often weak in patellofemoral issues

**4. Vastus Intermedius**
- Deep, beneath rectus femoris
- Knee extension

### Common Insertion

All four attach via the quadriceps tendon to the patella (kneecap), then continue as the patellar tendon to the tibia.

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Knee extension:**
- Standing from sitting
- Walking (swing phase)
- Climbing stairs
- Kicking

**Hip flexion (rectus femoris only):**
- Lifting thigh
- Walking
- Running

### Posture Role

**Pelvic influence:**
- Tight quads can tilt pelvis forward
- Especially rectus femoris
- Affects lower back curve

## Quadriceps and Women

### Common Patterns

**Q-angle consideration:**
- Women have wider pelvis
- Greater angle at knee
- May affect quad balance
- VMO often weaker

**Quad dominance:**
- Common compensation pattern
- Glutes underactive
- May lead to knee issues

## Imbalances

### Tight Quadriceps

**Causes:**
- Sitting (shortened position)
- Over-training
- Weak glutes (compensation)

**Effects:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Hip flexor tightness
- Knee pain
- Lower back strain

### Weak Quadriceps

**Causes:**
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Knee injury
- Disuse after surgery

**Effects:**
- Difficulty with stairs
- Knee instability
- Poor shock absorption

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Squats
- Lunges
- Step-ups
- Leg press
- Wall sits

### Stretching

- Standing quad stretch
- Lying quad stretch
- Couch stretch
- Foam rolling
