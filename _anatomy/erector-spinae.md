# Erector Spinae

The erector spinae is a group of muscles running along the length of the spine. They extend the back and are essential for maintaining upright posture.

## Anatomy

### Three Columns

**Iliocostalis (Lateral):**
- Most lateral
- Ribs to pelvis
- Regional divisions

**Longissimus (Middle):**
- Largest
- Spine and ribs
- To skull (capitis portion)

**Spinalis (Medial):**
- Most medial
- Spinous processes
- Smallest

### Full Length

**From skull to sacrum:**
- Regional portions
- Continuous muscle system
- Varies in size

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Extension:**
- Bending backward
- Returning from forward bend
- Maintaining upright posture

**Side bending (unilateral):**
- One side bends to same side

**Rotation (minor):**
- Assists rotation

### Postural Role

**Against gravity:**
- Constant low-level activity
- Prevents forward falling
- Maintains curves

## Common Issues

### Overwork

**When erector spinae compensates:**
- Weak deep core
- Hyperlordosis
- Poor mechanics

**Results:**
- Fatigue
- Spasm
- Pain
- Stiffness

### Spasm

**Protective response:**
- Injury
- Disc issues
- Sudden movement
- Overload

## Balance

### With Core

**Ideal pattern:**
- Core anticipates
- Erector spinae proportional
- Coordinated activity

### Common Imbalance

- Weak core
- Erector overworks
- Creates problems

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Back extensions
- Bird dog
- Superman
- Deadlifts (proper form)

### Releasing

- Child's pose
- Cat stretch
- Foam rolling
- Massage
