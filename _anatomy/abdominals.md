# Abdominal Muscles

The abdominals consist of four muscle layers that flex the trunk, rotate the torso, and stabilize the spine. Understanding their different roles helps target training appropriately.

## The Four Layers

### 1. Rectus Abdominis

**The "six-pack":**
- Most superficial
- Runs vertically
- Trunk flexion
- NOT the primary stabilizer

**Function:**
- Flexes trunk (crunching motion)
- Resists extension
- Assists with breathing

### 2. External Obliques

**Diagonal fibers (hands in pockets):**
- Second layer
- Rotate torso
- Side bending
- Largest of the obliques

**Function:**
- Rotate torso to opposite side
- Side bending same side
- Compress abdomen

### 3. Internal Obliques

**Diagonal fibers (opposite direction):**
- Third layer
- Deep to external obliques
- Work with opposite external

**Function:**
- Rotate torso to same side
- Side bending same side
- Compress abdomen

### 4. Transverse Abdominis

**Deepest layer:**
- Horizontal fibers
- Wraps like corset
- Primary stabilizer
- [See detailed: Core Muscles](/anatomy/core-muscles/)

## Function

### Movement

**Trunk flexion:** Rectus abdominis
**Rotation:** Obliques (working together)
**Side bending:** Obliques

### Stability

**Deep core:** Transverse abdominis
**Anti-rotation:** Obliques
**Anti-extension:** All layers

### Breathing

**Forced exhalation:** All layers compress
**Coughing, sneezing:** Increase pressure

## Women's Considerations

### Diastasis Recti

**Separation of rectus abdominis:**
- Common after pregnancy
- Linea alba stretches
- Affects function
- Can heal with proper approach

### Hormonal Influences

**Bloating patterns:**
- Menstrual cycle
- Not fat gain
- May affect appearance
- Normal variation

## Common Mistakes

### Overtraining Rectus

**Not ideal:**
- Crunches don't improve posture
- Can increase pressure downward
- Neglects deep core
- May worsen diastasis

### Neglecting Deep Core

**Better approach:**
- Train TrA first
- Add stability work
- Include anti-rotation
- Progress appropriately

## Exercises

### Deep Core

- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Dead bug
- Bird dog
- Pallof press

### Global

- Planks
- Carries
- Rotational exercises
- Functional movements
