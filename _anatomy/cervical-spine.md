# Cervical Spine

The cervical spine consists of seven vertebrae in the neck. This highly mobile region supports the head and is commonly affected by posture problems.

## Anatomy

### Structure

**7 vertebrae (C1-C7):**
- Smallest vertebrae
- Most mobile spine region
- Support 10-12 lb head

### Special Vertebrae

**C1 (Atlas):**
- Ring-shaped
- No vertebral body
- Supports skull
- Named for Atlas (Greek myth)

**C2 (Axis):**
- Has dens (odontoid process)
- Allows rotation
- Pivots with C1

### Natural Curve

**Lordosis:**
- Inward curve
- Similar to lumbar
- Can be affected by posture

## Movement

### Available Motions

**Flexion/Extension:** Nodding yes
**Rotation:** Shaking no
**Side bending:** Ear to shoulder

### Mobility Importance

**Balance needed:**
- Enough for function
- Not hypermobile
- Stable with movement

## Forward Head Posture

### What Happens

**Head moves forward:**
- Increases load on neck
- Changes muscle demands
- Creates compensation

### Load Increase

**For every inch forward:**
- Adds ~10 lbs of load
- Muscles work harder
- Strain increases

### Common Causes

- Phone use
- Computer work
- Driving
- Poor sitting posture

## Muscles Affected

### Overworked

- Suboccipitals
- Upper trapezius
- Levator scapulae
- SCM

### Weakened

- Deep neck flexors
- Lower cervical extensors

## Correction

### Key Strategies

- Chin tucks
- Neck strengthening
- Postural awareness
- Ergonomic changes

### Exercises

- Chin tucks
- Deep neck flexor training
- Upper back strengthening
- Neck stretches
