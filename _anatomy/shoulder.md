# Shoulder Anatomy

The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, allowing the arm to move in all directions. This mobility comes at the cost of stability, making muscle balance crucial.

## Joint Complex

### Three Joints

**1. Glenohumeral (GH) Joint**
- Main shoulder joint
- Ball and socket
- Most mobile

**2. Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint**
- Collarbone to shoulder blade
- Small but important

**3. Sternoclavicular (SC) Joint**
- Collarbone to breastbone
- Only bony connection to trunk

### Scapulothoracic Articulation

**Not a true joint:**
- Scapula glides on ribs
- Essential for shoulder function
- Requires muscle control

## The Rotator Cuff

### Four Muscles

**SITS muscles:**
1. **Supraspinatus** - Initiates abduction
2. **Infraspinatus** - External rotation
3. **Teres Minor** - External rotation
4. **Subscapularis** - Internal rotation

### Function

**Primary role:**
- Stabilize humeral head in socket
- Control rotation
- Allow mobility

**NOT primary movers:**
- Support larger muscles
- Precision control
- Injury-prone if weak

## Larger Shoulder Muscles

### Deltoid

**Three heads:**
- Anterior: Flexion
- Middle: Abduction
- Posterior: Extension

### Pectoralis Major

**Chest muscle:**
- Adduction
- Internal rotation
- Often tight

### Latissimus Dorsi

**Largest back muscle:**
- Extension
- Adduction
- Internal rotation

## Common Issues

### Impingement

**Pinching in shoulder:**
- Poor mechanics
- Posture-related
- Rotator cuff weakness

### Instability

**Too much mobility:**
- May be genetic
- Requires strengthening
- Common in women

## Posture Connection

### Rounded Shoulders

**Contributing factors:**
- Tight pectorals
- Weak rotator cuff
- Poor scapular control
- Forward head posture

### Improving Shoulder Posture

- Strengthen rotator cuff
- Open chest
- Improve scapular control
- Address thoracic spine
