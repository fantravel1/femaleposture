# Rhomboid Muscles

The rhomboids are muscles between the spine and shoulder blades that retract (pull back) the scapulae. They're essential for countering forward shoulder posture.

## Anatomy

### Two Muscles

**Rhomboid Minor:**
- Smaller, superior
- C7-T1 to scapula

**Rhomboid Major:**
- Larger, inferior
- T2-T5 to scapula

### Location

**Deep to trapezius:**
- Not visible externally
- Between spine and scapula
- Diamond-shaped fibers

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Scapular retraction:**
- Pull shoulder blades together
- "Squeeze" motion
- Rowing movements

**Scapular elevation:**
- Slight upward pull
- Works with levator scapulae

**Downward rotation:**
- Rotates scapula
- Opposite to upward rotation

## Posture Role

### Why They Matter

**Counter rounded shoulders:**
- Pull scapulae back
- Open chest
- Improve alignment

**Work with middle traps:**
- Together retract scapulae
- Both commonly weak

### Common Issues

**Weakness:**
- Scapulae wing out
- Rounded shoulders persist
- Shoulder problems develop

**Strain:**
- Between spine and shoulder blade
- From overwork or weakness
- Burning, aching pain

## Strengthening

### Exercises

**Retraction focus:**
- Rows (all variations)
- Face pulls
- Band pull-aparts
- Prone rows
- Scapular squeezes

### Key Points

- Squeeze shoulder blades
- Don't just pull with arms
- Control the movement
- Feel between scapulae

## Releasing

### When Tight or Sore

- Foam rolling (between spine and scapula)
- Tennis ball release
- Stretching pecs (indirect)
- Doorway stretch
