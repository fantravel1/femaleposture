# Triceps Brachii

The triceps is the three-headed muscle on the back of the upper arm, responsible for straightening the elbow. It's essential for pushing movements.

## Anatomy

### Three Heads

**Long head:**
- From scapula
- Crosses shoulder joint
- Extends and adducts shoulder

**Lateral head:**
- From humerus (posterior)
- Elbow extension only

**Medial head:**
- Deep, mostly covered
- From humerus (posterior)
- Active in all extension

### Insertion

**Common tendon:**
- Olecranon process of ulna
- Forms elbow point

## Function

### Primary Action

**Elbow extension:**
- Straightening arm
- Pushing movements
- Getting up from chair

### Secondary Actions

**Long head:**
- Shoulder extension
- Shoulder adduction

## Posture Considerations

### Limited Role

**Not primary postural muscle:**
- Involved in pushing
- Supports arm positioning

### When Tight

**May limit:**
- Overhead flexibility
- Shoulder flexion slightly

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Tricep dips
- Push-ups
- Overhead press
- Tricep pushdowns
- Skull crushers

### Stretching

- Overhead tricep stretch
- Cross-body stretch
