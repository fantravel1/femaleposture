# Latissimus Dorsi

The latissimus dorsi, or "lats," are the broadest muscles of the back. They connect the arms to the trunk and play important roles in pulling movements and posture.

## Anatomy

### Location

**Broad triangular muscle:**
- Covers much of lower back
- Wraps around sides
- Attaches to upper arm

### Attachments

**Origin (wide):**
- Lower six thoracic vertebrae
- Thoracolumbar fascia
- Iliac crest (pelvis)
- Lower ribs

**Insertion:**
- Humerus (upper arm)
- Front of the bone

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Shoulder movements:**
- Extension (arm back)
- Adduction (arm to side)
- Internal rotation
- Pulling downward

### Examples

**Activities using lats:**
- Pull-ups
- Swimming
- Rowing
- Climbing
- Pulling objects

### Breathing

**Accessory breathing muscle:**
- Assists forced inspiration
- Elevates ribs slightly

## Posture Effects

### Tight Lats

**Common effects:**
- Limited overhead reach
- Rounded shoulder posture
- Altered breathing mechanics
- Compensatory rib flare

**Causes:**
- Desk work
- Driving
- Lack of stretching
- Over-training pulling

### Weak Lats

**Effects:**
- Poor pulling strength
- Reduced stability
- Compensation by other muscles

## Assessment

### Overhead Reach Test

**Limited if:**
- Arms don't reach overhead
- Lower back arches
- Rib cage flares

### Wall Test

- Stand against wall
- Raise arms overhead
- Can arms touch wall?

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Lat pulldowns
- Pull-ups
- Rows
- Straight-arm pulldowns
- Swimmers

### Stretching

- Overhead lat stretch
- Child's pose with reach
- Side-lying rotation
- Foam rolling
