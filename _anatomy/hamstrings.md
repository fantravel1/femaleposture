# Hamstring Muscles

The hamstrings are three muscles on the back of the thigh that cross both the hip and knee. Their flexibility and strength significantly impact pelvic position and lower back health.

## Anatomy

### The Three Muscles

**1. Biceps Femoris**
- Two heads (long and short)
- Lateral (outer) hamstring
- Long head crosses hip

**2. Semitendinosus**
- Medial (inner) hamstring
- Long tendon
- Crosses hip and knee

**3. Semimembranosus**
- Deep medial hamstring
- Broader attachment
- Crosses hip and knee

### Attachments

**Origin:** Ischial tuberosity (sit bones)
**Insertion:** Tibia and fibula (below knee)

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Hip extension:**
- Standing from bent position
- Walking (push-off phase)
- Running
- Deadlifts

**Knee flexion:**
- Bending knee
- Walking (swing phase)
- Pulling heel toward buttock

### Posture Role

**Pelvic influence:**
- Can posteriorly tilt pelvis
- Counterbalances hip flexors
- Affects lumbar curve

## Hamstrings and Women

### Flexibility Considerations

**Often more flexible in women:**
- Hormonal influences
- Joint laxity
- May not need as much stretching

**But can still be tight from:**
- Prolonged sitting
- Underuse
- Protective guarding

### Strength Importance

**Commonly weaker than quads:**
- Quad-dominant patterns
- Less emphasis in training
- Important for injury prevention

## Imbalances

### Tight Hamstrings

**Causes:**
- Prolonged sitting
- Posterior pelvic tilt compensation
- Neural tension (not true shortness)

**Effects:**
- Limits hip flexion
- Affects squat depth
- May cause posterior pelvic tilt
- Lower back rounding

### Weak Hamstrings

**Causes:**
- Quad-dominant patterns
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Injury history

**Effects:**
- ACL injury risk
- Poor hip extension
- Knee instability
- Glute compensation needed

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Romanian deadlifts
- Nordic curls
- Glute-ham raises
- Leg curls
- Hip thrusts

### Stretching

- Forward fold
- Lying hamstring stretch
- Doorway stretch
- Foam rolling
