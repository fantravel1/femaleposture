# Pectoral Muscles

The pectoralis muscles on the front of the chest play a significant role in arm movements but often become tight, contributing to rounded shoulder posture.

## Anatomy

### Pectoralis Major

**Large fan-shaped muscle:**

**Two heads:**
- Clavicular (upper): From collarbone
- Sternal (lower): From sternum and ribs

**Insertion:** Humerus (upper arm)

### Pectoralis Minor

**Smaller, deeper muscle:**
**Origin:** Ribs 3-5
**Insertion:** Scapula (coracoid process)

**Important for posture:**
- Often short and tight
- Pulls scapula forward
- Contributes to rounding

## Function

### Pec Major

**Actions:**
- Adduction (arm across body)
- Internal rotation
- Flexion (clavicular)
- Extension (sternal)

### Pec Minor

**Actions:**
- Protracts scapula
- Depresses scapula
- Assists breathing

## Posture Impact

### When Tight

**Pec major:**
- Shoulders internally rotated
- Forward shoulder position
- Limits external rotation

**Pec minor:**
- Scapulae tilt forward
- Limits retraction
- Contributes to impingement

### The Rounded Shoulder Pattern

1. Pecs shorten from sitting
2. Pull shoulders forward
3. Upper back muscles lengthen
4. Posture deteriorates

## Stretching

### Doorway Stretch

**For pec major:**
- Forearm on doorframe
- Step through
- Vary arm position

### Corner Stretch

- Face corner
- Forearms on walls
- Lean in

### Ball Release

- Lie on tennis ball
- Below collarbone
- Roll gently

## Strengthening

**Balance with back work:**
- Push-ups
- Chest press
- But emphasize pulling more
