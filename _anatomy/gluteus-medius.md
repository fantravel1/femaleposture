# Gluteus Medius

The gluteus medius is located on the outer hip and is essential for pelvic stability during single-leg activities like walking. Its weakness is implicated in many lower body issues.

## Anatomy

### Location

**Outer hip:**
- Beneath gluteus maximus (partially)
- Fan-shaped
- Palpable at hip

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Outer surface of ilium
- Between iliac crest and greater trochanter

**Insertion:**
- Greater trochanter of femur

### Three Parts

**Anterior fibers:** Internal rotation
**Middle fibers:** Abduction
**Posterior fibers:** External rotation

## Function

### Primary Role

**Hip abduction:**
- Lifts leg to side
- In standing: stabilizes pelvis

### Critical Stabilization

**During single-leg stance:**
- Prevents hip drop (Trendelenburg)
- Every step in walking
- Running, climbing stairs

### Rotation

**Depending on position:**
- Can rotate internally or externally

## Why It Matters

### Weakness Effects

**Trendelenburg sign:**
- Pelvis drops on unsupported side
- Hip hikes to compensate
- Altered gait

**Downstream effects:**
- Knee valgus (collapse)
- IT band syndrome
- Patellofemoral pain
- Low back pain

### Common Weakness

**Very common, especially in:**
- Women
- Sedentary individuals
- After pregnancy
- Runners

## Assessment

### Single-Leg Stance

**Watch for:**
- Hip drop on opposite side
- Trunk lean
- Knee collapse

### Clamshell Test

**Difficulty indicates:**
- Gluteus medius weakness
- Common finding

## Strengthening

### Key Exercises

**Isolated:**
- Clamshells
- Side-lying leg raises
- Standing hip abduction

**Integrated:**
- Single-leg balance
- Single-leg squats
- Step-ups
- Lateral band walks
