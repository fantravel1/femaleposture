# Trapezius Muscle

The trapezius is a large diamond-shaped muscle spanning from the skull to the mid-back. Its three distinct parts have different functions and different posture implications.

## Anatomy

### Shape and Location

**Diamond-shaped:**
- Covers upper back
- Attaches to neck
- Controls scapula (shoulder blade)

### Three Parts

**Upper Trapezius:**
- Skull to scapula
- Elevates shoulder blade
- Often overactive

**Middle Trapezius:**
- Spine to scapula
- Retracts shoulder blade
- Often weak

**Lower Trapezius:**
- Lower thoracic to scapula
- Depresses and rotates scapula
- Often weak

## Function

### Scapular Control

**Upper traps:**
- Elevate shoulders
- Shrugging motion
- Carry heavy bags

**Middle traps:**
- Pull shoulder blades together
- Posture muscles
- Rowing motion

**Lower traps:**
- Pull shoulder blades down
- Upward rotation
- Overhead movement

### Head and Neck

**Upper traps:**
- Extend neck
- Side bend neck
- Rotation

## Posture Implications

### Common Imbalance

**Upper traps overactive:**
- Shoulder hiking
- Neck tension
- Headaches
- Stressed appearance

**Middle/lower traps weak:**
- Rounded shoulders
- Scapular winging
- Poor posture
- Shoulder problems

### The Typical Pattern

1. Sitting causes forward head
2. Upper traps overwork
3. Middle/lower traps lengthen
4. Cycle reinforces

## Rebalancing

### Strengthen

**Middle and lower traps:**
- Face pulls
- Rows
- Y raises
- T raises
- Prone exercises

### Relax

**Upper traps:**
- Stretching
- Massage
- Stress management
- Awareness of tension
