# Deltoid Muscles

The deltoid is the rounded muscle capping the shoulder, giving it shape. Its three distinct heads work together and separately to move the arm.

## Anatomy

### Three Heads

**1. Anterior (Front)**
- From clavicle
- Flexes shoulder
- Internal rotation

**2. Middle (Lateral)**
- From acromion
- Abducts arm
- Gives shoulder width

**3. Posterior (Rear)**
- From scapular spine
- Extends shoulder
- External rotation

### Common Insertion

**All attach to:**
- Deltoid tuberosity of humerus
- Side of upper arm

## Function

### Movement Production

**By head:**
- Front: Arm forward
- Middle: Arm out to side
- Rear: Arm backward

### Posture Role

**Balance matters:**
- Front often overdeveloped
- Rear often underdeveloped
- Affects shoulder position

## Common Imbalances

### Overdeveloped Anterior

**From:**
- Too much pressing
- Desk work posture
- Lack of pulling exercises

**Effects:**
- Internal rotation
- Rounded shoulders

### Weak Posterior

**Results in:**
- Poor posture
- Shoulder imbalance
- Impingement risk

## Exercises

### Anterior

- Front raises
- Shoulder press
- Push movements

### Middle

- Lateral raises
- Overhead pressing

### Posterior

- Reverse flys
- Face pulls
- Bent-over raises
