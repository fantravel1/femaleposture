# Gluteus Maximus

The gluteus maximus is the largest and most powerful muscle in the human body. It's essential for hip extension, posture, and athletic performance.

## Anatomy

### Size and Location

**Largest muscle:**
- Forms buttock shape
- Superficial layer
- Powerful architecture

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Posterior ilium
- Sacrum and coccyx
- Thoracolumbar fascia

**Insertion:**
- IT band
- Gluteal tuberosity of femur

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Hip extension:**
- Standing from sitting
- Climbing stairs
- Running and jumping
- Most powerful extensor

**External rotation:**
- Rotates thigh outward

**Abduction (upper fibers):**
- Assists gluteus medius

### Postural Role

**Standing upright:**
- Extends hip against gravity
- Controls forward trunk lean
- Essential for erect posture

## Common Dysfunction

### Weakness

**"Glute amnesia":**
- Sitting shuts them off
- Disuse weakness
- Common pattern

**Effects:**
- Hamstrings compensate
- Back muscles overwork
- Poor hip extension
- Athletic decline

### Inhibition

**When glutes won't activate:**
- Tight hip flexors
- Chronic sitting
- Pain patterns

## Importance for Women

### Pelvic Support

**Works with pelvic floor:**
- Hip stability
- Core integration

### Common Weakness

**Often weak in women:**
- Sitting-related
- Pregnancy effects
- Need specific training

## Exercises

### Activation

**Wake up the glutes:**
- Bridges
- Clamshells
- Quadruped hip extensions

### Strengthening

**Build power:**
- Hip thrusts
- Deadlifts
- Squats
- Lunges
- Step-ups

### Key Points

- Feel the glutes working
- Don't let quads dominate
- Progress gradually
