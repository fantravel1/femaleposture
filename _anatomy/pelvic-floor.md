# Pelvic Floor Muscles

The pelvic floor is a group of muscles spanning the bottom of the pelvis, essential for core support, organ function, and postural stability. For women, these muscles have particular significance throughout life stages.

## Anatomy Overview

### Location and Structure

The pelvic floor forms a muscular hammock from the pubic bone to the tailbone:

**Key muscles:**
- Levator ani (largest muscle group)
- Coccygeus
- Deep transverse perinei
- External urethral sphincter
- External anal sphincter

### The Levator Ani

**Three components:**
1. **Pubococcygeus** - front to back support
2. **Puborectalis** - surrounds rectum
3. **Iliococcygeus** - side support

## Function

### Primary Roles

**Support function:**
- Holds pelvic organs in place
- Supports bladder, uterus, rectum
- Counteracts downward pressure

**Sphincter function:**
- Controls bladder
- Controls bowels
- Enables continence

**Sexual function:**
- Contributes to sexual response
- Important for sexual health

### Connection to Posture

**Core integration:**
- Works with diaphragm (opposites)
- Part of deep core system
- Affects spinal stability

**Postural influence:**
- Pelvic positioning
- Trunk stability
- Foundation for movement

## Common Issues

### Weakness

**Causes:**
- Pregnancy and childbirth
- Aging
- Chronic straining
- Heavy lifting
- Obesity

**Effects:**
- Incontinence
- Prolapse
- Core weakness
- Back pain

### Overactivity

**Causes:**
- Chronic holding
- Stress and tension
- Pain conditions
- Postural dysfunction

**Effects:**
- Pelvic pain
- Painful intercourse
- Urinary urgency
- Constipation

## Training the Pelvic Floor

### Strengthening

**Kegel exercises:**
- Squeeze and lift
- Hold 5-10 seconds
- Relax completely
- 10-15 repetitions

**Integration:**
- Coordinate with breathing
- Include in daily activities
- Progress to functional movements

### Relaxation

Equally important as strength:
- Breathing exercises
- Stretching hip muscles
- Stress management
- Body awareness

## Life Stage Considerations

### Pregnancy

- Hormonal changes affect tissues
- Increased pressure from baby
- Importance of maintaining function
- Preparation for birth

### Postpartum

- Recovery takes time (months)
- May need rehabilitation
- Gradual return to exercise
- Pelvic floor PT if needed

### Menopause

- Hormonal changes affect tissues
- May experience new symptoms
- Continued training important
- Seek help if issues arise

## When to Seek Help

**See a pelvic floor PT if:**
- Urinary leakage
- Fecal incontinence
- Pelvic pressure or heaviness
- Pain during intercourse
- Chronic constipation
- Unable to activate pelvic floor
