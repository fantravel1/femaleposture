# Rotator Cuff Muscles

The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that stabilize the shoulder joint and control rotation. Their health is essential for pain-free shoulder function.

## The Four Muscles (SITS)

### 1. Supraspinatus

**Location:** Above scapular spine
**Action:** Initiates arm abduction
**Most commonly injured:** Due to position under acromion

### 2. Infraspinatus

**Location:** Below scapular spine
**Action:** External rotation
**Important for:** Posture and overhead activities

### 3. Teres Minor

**Location:** Border of scapula
**Action:** External rotation
**Works with:** Infraspinatus

### 4. Subscapularis

**Location:** Front of scapula
**Action:** Internal rotation
**Largest:** Of the four

## Function

### Stabilization

**Primary role:**
- Keep ball centered in socket
- Control humeral head
- Allow mobility with stability

### Force Couples

**Working with deltoid:**
- Rotator cuff depresses head
- Allows deltoid to abduct
- Coordination essential

### Rotation Control

**External rotators (2):**
- Infraspinatus
- Teres minor

**Internal rotator (1):**
- Subscapularis

## Common Problems

### Tendinitis

**Inflammation:**
- Overuse
- Poor mechanics
- Age-related changes

### Tears

**Partial or complete:**
- Acute injury
- Degenerative
- May require surgery

### Weakness

**Effects:**
- Poor stability
- Shoulder pain
- Impingement

## Women's Considerations

### Laxity

**Joint looseness:**
- More common in women
- Requires more stability
- Strengthening important

### Hormonal Effects

- May affect tissue health
- Pregnancy considerations
- Menopause changes

## Strengthening

### External Rotation

- Side-lying rotation
- Cable rotation
- Band rotation

### Comprehensive

- Full can exercise
- Empty can (careful)
- Prone exercises
- Face pulls

## Prevention

### Key Strategies

- Regular strengthening
- Posture awareness
- Avoid overuse
- Balanced training
