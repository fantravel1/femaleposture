# The Diaphragm

The diaphragm is your primary breathing muscle and a crucial component of core stability. This dome-shaped muscle separates the chest from the abdomen and plays a far greater role in posture than most realize.

## Anatomy

### Structure

**Shape:** Dome-like when relaxed
**Location:** Separates thorax from abdomen
**Attachment points:**
- Sternum (front)
- Lower ribs (sides)
- Lumbar vertebrae (back via crura)

### Openings

Three major openings allow structures to pass through:
- Aortic hiatus (aorta)
- Esophageal hiatus (esophagus)
- Caval opening (vena cava)

## Function

### Breathing

**Inhalation:**
- Diaphragm contracts and flattens
- Creates negative pressure in chest
- Air rushes into lungs
- Abdomen expands

**Exhalation:**
- Diaphragm relaxes and domes
- Pressure pushes air out
- Passive during quiet breathing
- Active during forced exhale

### Core Stability

**Creates intra-abdominal pressure:**
- Works with pelvic floor
- Coordinates with TrA
- Stabilizes spine

**Anticipatory activation:**
- Contracts before limb movement
- Prepares spine for forces
- Automatic when functioning well

## Connection to Posture

### Good Diaphragm Function

**Results in:**
- Efficient breathing
- Strong core activation
- Spinal stability
- Relaxed neck and shoulders

### Dysfunctional Breathing

**Common patterns:**
- Chest breathing (shallow)
- Breath holding
- Accessory muscle overuse
- Neck tension

**Effects on posture:**
- Neck muscles overwork
- Shoulders elevate
- Thoracic stiffness
- Core dysfunction

## Diaphragmatic Breathing

### How to Practice

1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Hand on belly, hand on chest
3. Breathe in through nose
4. Belly rises (chest quiet)
5. Exhale slowly
6. Belly falls naturally

### Benefits

- Activates deep core
- Reduces neck tension
- Improves thoracic mobility
- Manages stress response

## Common Issues

### Upper Chest Breathing

**Causes:**
- Stress and anxiety
- Tight abdominals
- Poor posture habits
- Thoracic stiffness

**Solutions:**
- Diaphragmatic breathing practice
- Thoracic mobility work
- Stress management
- Postural awareness

### Hiatal Hernia

**When stomach pushes through hiatus:**
- Can cause reflux
- May affect breathing
- Posture may influence
- Medical attention needed
