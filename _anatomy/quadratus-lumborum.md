# Quadratus Lumborum (QL)

The quadratus lumborum is a deep muscle connecting the pelvis to the spine and ribs. It's a common source of low back pain and often compensates for weak core muscles.

## Anatomy

### Location

**Deep to erector spinae:**
- Back of abdominal wall
- Between last rib and pelvis

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Iliac crest (posterior)
- Iliolumbar ligament

**Insertion:**
- 12th rib
- L1-L4 transverse processes

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Lateral flexion:**
- Side bending
- Picking up bag from side

**Hip hiking:**
- Elevates pelvis
- Walking (clears foot)

**Extension:**
- Assists back extension

### Stabilization

**Spinal support:**
- Frontal plane stability
- Core stabilizer role

## Common Problems

### Overwork

**When QL compensates:**
- Weak gluteus medius
- Weak core
- Leg length difference

**Results in:**
- Chronic tension
- Low back pain
- Trigger points

### Trigger Points

**Located in muscle:**
- Very common
- Deep, achy pain
- May refer to hip

## Why It Gets Tight

### Compensation Patterns

1. Weak hip abductors
2. QL hikes hip during walking
3. Overworks chronically
4. Becomes tight and painful

### Postural Factors

- Sitting asymmetrically
- Carrying bags on one side
- Leg length discrepancy
- Scoliosis

## Treatment

### Stretching

**Side-lying stretch:**
1. Lie on side
2. Top leg behind bottom
3. Reach top arm overhead
4. Feel deep stretch

**Doorway stretch:**
1. Side to doorframe
2. Lean away
3. Stretch along side

### Strengthening (When Needed)

- Side planks
- Side bends
- Pallof press

### Addressing Cause

- Strengthen glutes
- Core work
- Check leg length
- Symmetrical habits
