# Sternocleidomastoid (SCM)

The SCM is the prominent muscle on the front and side of the neck. It's easily visible when turning the head and often becomes tight with forward head posture.

## Anatomy

### Two Heads

**Sternal head:**
- From sternum (breastbone)
- More medial

**Clavicular head:**
- From clavicle (collarbone)
- More lateral

### Insertion

**Common attachment:**
- Mastoid process (behind ear)
- Superior nuchal line

## Function

### Bilateral Action (Both Sides)

**Together:**
- Flex neck (chin to chest)
- Protrude head forward

### Unilateral Action (One Side)

**Single side:**
- Rotate head to opposite side
- Side bend to same side

### Accessory Breathing

**When breathing is strained:**
- Lifts ribcage
- Accessory muscle
- Shouldn't be primary

## Posture Role

### Forward Head Posture

**SCM becomes:**
- Shortened
- Overworked
- Tight
- Painful

### Why It Happens

1. Head moves forward
2. SCM shortens
3. Works constantly to support head
4. Becomes hypertonic

## Problems

### Tightness

**Symptoms:**
- Neck stiffness
- Headaches
- Jaw tension
- Difficulty turning head

### Trigger Points

**Can refer to:**
- Forehead
- Around eye
- Cheek
- Ear

## Treatment

### Stretching

1. Tilt head back slightly
2. Rotate away from side stretching
3. Gentle stretch on front of neck
4. Hold 20-30 seconds

### Self-Release

- Gentle massage
- Pin and rotate
- Careful pressure
