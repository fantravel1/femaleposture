# Lumbar Spine

The lumbar spine consists of five large vertebrae in the lower back. This region bears significant load and is commonly affected by posture-related issues.

## Anatomy

### Structure

**5 vertebrae (L1-L5):**
- Largest vertebrae
- Weight-bearing
- No rib attachments

### Intervertebral Discs

**Between each vertebra:**
- Shock absorption
- Allow movement
- Can bulge or herniate

### Natural Curve

**Lordosis:**
- Inward curve (anterior convexity)
- Normal: 40-60 degrees
- Varies individually

## Movement

### Available Motions

**Flexion:** Forward bending
**Extension:** Backward bending
**Side bending:** Limited
**Rotation:** Very limited

### Mobility Needs

**Balance needed:**
- Too stiff: Problems
- Too mobile: Instability
- Controlled mobility ideal

## Posture Role

### Lordosis Variations

**Excessive (hyperlordosis):**
- Deep curve
- Often with anterior pelvic tilt
- Related to tight hip flexors

**Reduced (flat back):**
- Less curve
- Often with posterior pelvic tilt
- Can cause different problems

### Neutral Spine

**Ideal:**
- Natural curve maintained
- Not excessive or flattened
- Supported by core muscles

## Load and Stress

### Standing

**Load distribution:**
- Compression on discs
- Muscles provide support
- Posture affects load

### Sitting

**Increased stress:**
- Flexes lumbar spine
- Reduces lordosis
- Loads discs more

### Lifting

**Proper mechanics:**
- Maintain neutral spine
- Hip hinge pattern
- Avoid flexion under load

## Common Issues

### Disc Problems

- Bulges
- Herniations
- Related to posture and mechanics

### Facet Joint Issues

- Extension-based pain
- May relate to hyperlordosis

### Muscle Issues

- Spasm
- Weakness
- Imbalance

## Core Support

### Deep Core

**Stabilizes lumbar spine:**
- Transverse abdominis
- Multifidus
- Pelvic floor
- Diaphragm

### Importance

- Protects spine
- Reduces load on passive structures
- Enables safe movement
