# Thoracic Spine

The thoracic spine is the twelve vertebrae of the mid-back. This region is naturally kyphotic (curved outward) and connects to the ribs, making it unique in the spine.

## Anatomy

### Structure

**12 vertebrae (T1-T12):**
- Larger than cervical
- Smaller than lumbar
- Connect to ribs

### Rib Connections

**Two joints per rib:**
- Costovertebral (vertebral body)
- Costotransverse (transverse process)

**Creates stability but limits mobility**

### Natural Curve

**Kyphosis:**
- Outward curve (posterior convexity)
- Normal: 20-40 degrees
- Excessive: Hyperkyphosis

## Movement

### Available Motions

**Rotation:** Most available here
**Flexion/Extension:** Limited by ribs
**Side bending:** Moderate

### Mobility Importance

**When stiff:**
- Compensations above and below
- Shoulder dysfunction
- Neck problems
- Lower back stress

## Posture Role

### Normal Thoracic Curve

**Optimal:**
- Natural kyphosis maintained
- Not excessive
- Not flattened

### Excessive Kyphosis

**Hyperkyphosis:**
- Rounded upper back
- Forward head follows
- Common with aging
- Related to osteoporosis risk

### Flat Thoracic Spine

**Less common:**
- Military posture extreme
- May cause stiffness
- Affects breathing

## Breathing Connection

### Rib Movement

**During breathing:**
- Ribs should expand 360 degrees
- Thoracic spine moves slightly
- Stiffness limits breathing

### Improving Both

- Thoracic mobility helps breathing
- Breathing helps thoracic mobility
- Address together

## Improving Mobility

### Exercises

- Foam roller extensions
- Cat-cow (focus on upper back)
- Thread the needle
- Book openers
- Thoracic rotation

### Key Points

- Don't force
- Gentle pressure
- Consistency matters
- Combine with breathing
