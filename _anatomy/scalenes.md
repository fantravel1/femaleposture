# Scalene Muscles

The scalenes are three muscles on each side of the neck connecting the cervical spine to the first two ribs. They're important for breathing and can contribute to neck and arm symptoms.

## Anatomy

### Three Muscles

**1. Anterior Scalene**
- C3-C6 to first rib
- Most anterior

**2. Middle Scalene**
- C2-C7 to first rib
- Behind anterior scalene

**3. Posterior Scalene**
- C5-C7 to second rib
- Most posterior

### Key Structure

**Brachial plexus and subclavian artery:**
- Pass between anterior and middle scalenes
- Can be compressed

## Function

### Neck Movements

**Bilateral:**
- Neck flexion

**Unilateral:**
- Side bending
- Rotation (minor)

### Breathing

**Accessory breathing muscle:**
- Elevates ribs
- Expands upper chest
- Should not be primary

## Problems

### Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

**Compression of nerves/vessels:**
- Between scalenes
- Causes arm symptoms
- Numbness, tingling, weakness

### Overuse

**From breathing pattern disorders:**
- Upper chest breathing
- Stress breathing
- Chronic tension

### Trigger Points

**Refer pain to:**
- Chest
- Upper back
- Arm
- Hand

## Treatment

### Stretching

1. Tilt head away from side stretching
2. Slight rotation
3. Hand on collarbone to stabilize
4. Gentle, sustained stretch

### Breathing Correction

- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Reduce upper chest pattern
- Decrease scalene overuse
