# Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL)

The TFL is a small but often overactive muscle at the front of the hip that connects to the IT band. It commonly compensates for weak glutes.

## Anatomy

### Location

**Outer front hip:**
- Between iliac crest and greater trochanter
- Blends into IT band

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)
- Outer lip of iliac crest

**Insertion:**
- IT band (iliotibial tract)
- Continues to lateral tibia

## Function

### Actions

**Hip flexion:**
- Assists iliopsoas

**Hip abduction:**
- Lifts leg to side

**Hip internal rotation:**
- Rotates thigh in

**Knee:**
- Helps stabilize through IT band

## Common Problems

### TFL Dominance

**When TFL compensates:**
- For weak gluteus medius
- For weak gluteus maximus
- Common pattern

**Results:**
- IT band tightness
- Lateral knee pain
- Hip snapping
- Overuse

### IT Band Issues

**Connected problems:**
- IT band friction syndrome
- Lateral hip pain
- Knee pain

## Why It Overworks

### Glute Weakness

1. Glutes weak or inhibited
2. TFL takes over abduction
3. IT band tightens
4. Problems develop

### Signs of Dominance

- Feel TFL during hip exercises
- IT band always tight
- Hip snapping

## Treatment

### Address the Cause

**Strengthen glutes:**
- Clamshells
- Side-lying abduction (glute focus)
- Bridges

### Release TFL

- Foam rolling (carefully)
- Stretching
- Soft tissue work

### Stretch

**Side-lying stretch:**
- Cross leg behind
- Let hip stretch
