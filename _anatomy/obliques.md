# Oblique Muscles

The obliques are two layers of diagonal abdominal muscles that rotate the trunk and provide anti-rotation stability.

## Anatomy

### External Obliques

**Superficial layer:**
- Fibers run down and toward midline
- "Hands in pockets" direction
- Largest of the obliques

**Attachments:**
- Origin: Lower 8 ribs
- Insertion: Iliac crest, linea alba

### Internal Obliques

**Deeper layer:**
- Fibers run up and toward midline
- Opposite direction to external
- Work with opposite external oblique

**Attachments:**
- Origin: Thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest
- Insertion: Lower ribs, linea alba

## Function

### Rotation

**Working together:**
- Right external + left internal = rotate left
- Left external + right internal = rotate right

### Flexion

**Both sides together:**
- Assist trunk flexion
- Work with rectus abdominis

### Side Bending

**Same side:**
- Lateral flexion
- Working with opposite side obliques

### Anti-Rotation

**Stability function:**
- Resist rotation forces
- Core stability
- Protect spine

## Posture Role

### Trunk Stability

**Important for:**
- Rotational control
- Side-to-side stability
- Supporting spine

### Common Weakness

**Often underdeveloped:**
- Focus on rectus abdominis
- Neglect rotational training
- Imbalance develops

## Exercises

### Rotation

- Russian twists
- Cable rotations
- Medicine ball throws

### Anti-Rotation

- Pallof press
- Plank with reach
- Bird dog

### Side Work

- Side planks
- Side bends
- Suitcase carries
