# Levator Scapulae

The levator scapulae runs from the upper cervical spine to the shoulder blade. It's one of the most common sources of neck and shoulder tension.

## Anatomy

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Transverse processes C1-C4
- Upper cervical vertebrae

**Insertion:**
- Superior angle of scapula
- Upper corner of shoulder blade

### Location

**Posterolateral neck:**
- Deep to trapezius
- Between neck and shoulder
- Often palpably tight

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Elevates scapula:**
- Shoulder shrugging
- Carrying bags

**Downward rotation:**
- Returns arm from overhead

**Neck movements (when scapula fixed):**
- Side bending
- Rotation

## Common Problems

### Chronic Tension

**Causes:**
- Desk work
- Stress
- Phone use
- Carrying heavy bags
- Poor posture

**Results:**
- Constant tightness
- Neck pain
- Headaches
- Limited range of motion

### Trigger Points

**Located at:**
- Upper angle of scapula
- Along muscle belly

**Refer to:**
- Angle of neck and shoulder
- Down along scapula
- Base of skull

## Why It Gets Tight

### Posture Connection

1. Head moves forward
2. Shoulders elevate unconsciously
3. Levator constantly contracted
4. Becomes hypertonic

### Stress Connection

- Tension held in shoulders
- "Shoulders up to ears"
- Chronic contraction

## Treatment

### Stretching

1. Sit or stand
2. Look down and toward opposite armpit
3. Hand gently assists stretch
4. Feel stretch at back of neck
5. Hold 30 seconds

### Self-Release

- Tennis ball against wall
- Foam roller
- Massage
- Heat application

## Prevention

- Regular stretches
- Posture awareness
- Stress management
- Ergonomic setup
- Don't carry heavy bags on shoulder
