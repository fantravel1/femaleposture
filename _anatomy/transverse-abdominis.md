# Transverse Abdominis (TrA)

The transverse abdominis is the deepest abdominal muscle, wrapping around the trunk like a corset. It's the primary stabilizer of the spine and pelvis.

## Anatomy

### Location

**Deepest layer:**
- Beneath obliques
- Horizontal fiber direction
- Wraps around trunk

### Attachments

**Origin:**
- Lower six ribs (inner)
- Thoracolumbar fascia
- Iliac crest
- Inguinal ligament

**Insertion:**
- Linea alba (midline)
- Pubic bone

## Function

### Primary Role

**Stability:**
- Compresses abdominal contents
- Increases intra-abdominal pressure
- Supports spine before movement

### Anticipatory Activation

**Automatic response:**
- Contracts before limb movement
- Prepares spine for forces
- Happens unconsciously when healthy

### Not a Movement Muscle

**Does not:**
- Flex trunk
- Create visible movement
- Work like rectus abdominis

## Importance

### For Posture

**Foundation of core:**
- Supports spine
- Affects pelvic position
- Works with pelvic floor

### For Back Health

**When functioning well:**
- Protects spine
- Distributes forces
- Reduces injury risk

### When Dysfunctional

**After injury, pregnancy, etc.:**
- Delayed activation
- Doesn't automatically protect
- Must be retrained

## Training the TrA

### Finding It

**Subtle activation:**
- Gentle draw-in of lower belly
- Below navel
- NOT sucking in hard

### Exercises

**Progressive:**
1. Breathing with gentle engagement
2. Heel slides
3. Dead bug
4. Bird dog
5. Functional integration

### Key Points

- Quality over quantity
- Coordination matters
- Don't hold breath
- Integrate into movement
