# Iliopsoas

The iliopsoas is actually two muscles (psoas major and iliacus) that merge to form the primary hip flexor. Its condition significantly affects pelvic and spinal posture.

## Anatomy

### Two Muscles

**Psoas Major:**
- From lumbar vertebrae (T12-L5)
- Only muscle connecting spine to leg
- Deep in abdomen

**Iliacus:**
- From iliac fossa (inside pelvis)
- Fan-shaped
- Joins psoas

### Common Insertion

**Lesser trochanter:**
- Inner upper femur
- Merged tendon

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Hip flexion:**
- Most powerful hip flexor
- Lifting thigh
- Walking, running, stairs

**Lumbar spine:**
- Psoas affects lumbar curve
- When tight, increases lordosis

### Postural Role

**Connects spine to leg:**
- Unique positioning
- Affects both regions
- Key postural muscle

## The Psoas and Posture

### When Tight

**Effects:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Increased lumbar lordosis
- Lower back compression
- Hip discomfort

### Why It Shortens

- Prolonged sitting
- Sleeping in fetal position
- Too much hip flexion
- Stress (connection to diaphragm)

## Assessment

### Thomas Test

**Hip flexor length:**
1. Lie on table edge
2. Pull one knee to chest
3. Other leg hangs
4. Thigh should be parallel to table

**If thigh lifts:** Hip flexor tightness

## Exercises

### Stretching

**Half-kneeling stretch:**
- Knee on ground
- Tuck pelvis
- Shift forward
- Feel front of hip

**Low lunge variations**

### Strengthening

- Hanging leg raises
- Marching
- Dead bugs
