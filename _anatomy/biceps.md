# Biceps Brachii

The biceps is the prominent muscle on the front of the upper arm. Despite its visibility, its role in posture is limited but worth understanding.

## Anatomy

### Two Heads

**Long head:**
- From supraglenoid tubercle
- Crosses shoulder joint
- More lateral

**Short head:**
- From coracoid process
- More medial

### Insertion

**Common insertion:**
- Radial tuberosity
- Bicipital aponeurosis

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Elbow flexion:**
- Bending elbow
- Lifting objects

**Forearm supination:**
- Palm up position
- Turning doorknob

**Shoulder flexion (assist):**
- Minor role
- From long head

## Posture Considerations

### Limited Direct Role

**In posture:**
- Not a primary posture muscle
- Can become tight
- May limit overhead reach

### When Tight

**Effects:**
- Limited elbow extension
- Shoulder positioning affected
- Often from training imbalance

## Stretching

### Doorway Stretch

1. Arm behind in doorway
2. Palm facing up
3. Turn body away
4. Feel front of arm stretch
