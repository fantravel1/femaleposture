# Lower Back Muscles

The lower back contains layers of muscles that extend, rotate, and stabilize the lumbar spine. Understanding these muscles helps address common lower back issues.

## Muscle Layers

### Superficial Layer

**Erector Spinae:**
Three columns running along the spine:
- Iliocostalis (lateral)
- Longissimus (middle)
- Spinalis (medial)

**Functions:**
- Extend spine (bend backward)
- Side bending
- Maintain upright posture

### Intermediate Layer

**Quadratus Lumborum (QL):**
- Connects pelvis to ribs
- Side bending
- Hip hiking
- Often tight or overworked

### Deep Layer

**Multifidus:**
- Small muscles between vertebrae
- Segmental stability
- Often weak in back pain
- Key for recovery

**Rotatores:**
- Smallest, deepest
- Rotation between vertebrae
- Proprioceptive feedback

## Function

### Stability

**Deep muscles:**
- Control individual segments
- Anticipatory activation
- Protect spine during movement

### Movement

**Superficial muscles:**
- Gross movements
- Power production
- Maintain posture against gravity

### Posture

**Standing:**
- Constant low-level activity
- Counter gravity
- Control curves

## Common Issues

### Muscle Spasm

**Protective response to:**
- Injury
- Disc problems
- Poor mechanics
- Overuse

### Weakness

**Deep muscle weakness:**
- Common in chronic back pain
- Delayed activation
- Lost automatic control

### Overactivity

**Superficial muscle overuse:**
- Compensating for weak core
- Poor posture habits
- Creates fatigue and pain

## Balance with Core

### Ideal Pattern

- Deep core anticipates movement
- Back muscles work proportionally
- No single muscle overworking
- Efficient movement

### Common Imbalance

- Weak deep core
- Back muscles compensate
- Fatigue and pain result
- Cycle continues

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Bird dog
- Superman variations
- Back extensions
- Deadlifts (with good form)

### Releasing

- Child's pose
- Cat-cow
- Knee-to-chest
- Foam rolling (carefully)
