# Multifidus

The multifidus is a series of small but crucial muscles that provide segmental stability to the spine. Their proper function is essential for preventing and recovering from back pain.

## Anatomy

### Structure

**Location:** Deep to erector spinae
**Spans:** Entire length of spine
**Attachments:** Between adjacent vertebrae (2-4 levels)

### Fiber Direction

**Diagonal orientation:**
- Provides rotational control
- Connects spinous process to transverse process
- Creates extension force

## Function

### Segmental Stability

**Primary role:**
- Stabilizes individual vertebrae
- Prevents excessive motion
- Protects discs and joints

### Anticipatory Activation

**Before movement:**
- Activates before limb movement
- Prepares spine for forces
- Automatic when healthy

### Proprioception

**Sensory function:**
- Rich in position sensors
- Feedback about spine position
- Important for motor control

## Multifidus and Back Pain

### What Happens

**In back pain:**
- Rapid atrophy (wasting)
- Fatty infiltration
- Delayed activation
- Doesn't automatically recover

### Research Findings

**Studies show:**
- Visible atrophy within days of injury
- Doesn't recover without specific exercise
- Size correlates with function
- Training can restore function

## Why It Matters

### Without Healthy Multifidus

- Spine lacks segmental control
- Other muscles compensate
- Increased injury risk
- Chronic pain patterns

### With Healthy Multifidus

- Automatic spinal support
- Efficient movement
- Reduced injury risk
- Better recovery

## Training the Multifidus

### Key Principles

**Low load, specific activation:**
- Not about strength initially
- About timing and control
- Quality over quantity

### Exercises

**Progression:**
1. Diaphragmatic breathing
2. Gentle core activation
3. Bird dog
4. Dead bug
5. Functional integration

### What NOT to Do

- High-load back extensions
- Momentum-based movements
- Exercises causing pain
- Ignoring proper form
