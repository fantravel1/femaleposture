# Calf Muscles

The calf muscles on the back of the lower leg are essential for walking, standing, and ankle stability. Their flexibility affects squat mechanics and overall posture.

## Anatomy

### Gastrocnemius

**Location:** Superficial (visible) calf muscle
**Two heads:** Medial and lateral
**Crosses:** Both knee and ankle

**Attachments:**
- Origin: Femur (above knee)
- Insertion: Calcaneus via Achilles tendon

### Soleus

**Location:** Deep to gastrocnemius
**Crosses:** Ankle only
**Often called:** "Second heart" (venous return)

**Attachments:**
- Origin: Tibia and fibula
- Insertion: Calcaneus via Achilles tendon

### Achilles Tendon

Strongest tendon in body connecting both muscles to heel bone.

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Plantarflexion:**
- Pointing toes down
- Push-off in walking
- Rising onto toes
- Jumping

**Knee flexion (gastrocnemius):**
- Assists hamstrings
- When foot is planted

### Posture Role

**Standing balance:**
- Constant small adjustments
- Sway control
- Weight distribution

**Gait:**
- Propulsion forward
- Shock absorption
- Efficient walking

## Calf Tightness

### Causes

- High heel wearing
- Prolonged sitting
- Running without stretching
- Lack of ankle mobility work

### Effects on Posture

**Ankle dorsiflexion limitation:**
- Heels lift during squats
- Compensations up the chain
- Knee tracking issues
- Hip and back compensation

**Gait changes:**
- Shorter stride
- Altered foot mechanics
- Increased strain elsewhere

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Calf raises (straight leg)
- Seated calf raises (bent knee)
- Single-leg calf raises
- Jumping/plyometrics

### Stretching

- Wall calf stretch (straight knee)
- Soleus stretch (bent knee)
- Downward dog
- Step stretch

### Mobility

- Ankle circles
- Foam rolling
- Massage ball work

## Women's Considerations

### High Heels

**Effects of regular wear:**
- Adaptive shortening
- Achilles tightness
- Altered muscle length
- Posture changes

**Recommendations:**
- Vary heel heights
- Stretch regularly
- Strengthen through full range
