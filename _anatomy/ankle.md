# Ankle Anatomy

The ankle is a complex of joints allowing the foot to move in multiple directions. Ankle mobility significantly affects squat mechanics, gait, and overall posture.

## Joint Structure

### Talocrural Joint

**Primary ankle joint:**
- Tibia, fibula, and talus
- Hinge joint
- Plantarflexion and dorsiflexion

### Subtalar Joint

**Below the ankle:**
- Talus and calcaneus
- Inversion and eversion
- Pronation and supination

## Movements

### Dorsiflexion

- Toes toward shin
- Required for: Squatting, walking, stairs
- Normal range: 15-20 degrees

### Plantarflexion

- Pointing toes
- Required for: Push-off, rising on toes
- Normal range: 40-55 degrees

### Inversion/Eversion

- Sole turning in/out
- Important for: Uneven surfaces
- Balance and adaptation

## Posture Importance

### Limited Dorsiflexion

**Causes:**
- Tight calves
- Joint stiffness
- Previous injury
- High heel wearing

**Compensation patterns:**
- Early heel lift in squats
- Knee collapse inward
- Excessive forward lean
- Back rounding

### Ankle Instability

**Effects up the chain:**
- Poor balance
- Altered gait
- Knee stress
- Hip compensation

## Assessment

### Knee-to-Wall Test

1. Face wall, foot flat
2. Lunge knee toward wall
3. Keep heel down
4. Measure distance when knee touches

**Normal:** ~10-12 cm (4-5 inches)

## Improving Mobility

### Stretching

- Calf stretches (both muscles)
- Ankle circles
- Alphabet with toes

### Joint Mobilization

- Banded ankle mobilization
- Half-kneeling stretch
- Squat with heel elevation
