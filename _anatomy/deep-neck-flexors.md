# Deep Neck Flexors

The deep neck flexors are small muscles at the front of the cervical spine. They're essential for head positioning and often weak in those with forward head posture.

## Anatomy

### Key Muscles

**Longus Colli:**
- Along front of cervical vertebrae
- C1 to T3
- Primary stabilizer

**Longus Capitis:**
- To base of skull
- Deeper than SCM

### Location

**Deep cervical:**
- Behind trachea
- In front of spine
- Not palpable

## Function

### Primary Role

**Cervical stabilization:**
- Hold head position
- Support cervical curve
- Control head on neck

### Movements

**Flexion:**
- Chin tuck motion
- Nod "yes"
- Control extension

### Postural Role

**Critical for:**
- Maintaining head position
- Counteracting extension forces
- Supporting cervical lordosis

## Deep Neck Flexor Weakness

### Common Pattern

**Forward head posture:**
1. Head moves forward
2. Deep flexors lengthen
3. Become weak
4. Can't counteract

### Effects

**When weak:**
- Forward head worsens
- SCM overworks
- Suboccipitals tighten
- Neck pain develops

### Testing

**Craniocervical flexion test:**
- Lie on back
- Tuck chin gently
- Assess holding ability

## Strengthening

### Chin Tucks

**The key exercise:**
1. Lie on back
2. Gently tuck chin
3. Make "double chin"
4. Hold 5-10 seconds
5. Progress to longer holds

### Progressions

**Increase challenge:**
- Seated chin tucks
- Standing chin tucks
- Against resistance
- During activities

### Key Points

- Gentle, not forceful
- Quality over quantity
- Consistency matters
- Combine with posture awareness
