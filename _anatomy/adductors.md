# Adductor Muscles

The adductors are a group of muscles on the inner thigh that bring the leg toward the midline. They also play important roles in hip stability and pelvic floor function.

## Anatomy

### The Muscles

**Five primary adductors:**

1. **Adductor Longus**
   - Most superficial
   - Commonly strained
   
2. **Adductor Brevis**
   - Deep to longus
   
3. **Adductor Magnus**
   - Largest and most powerful
   - Has two parts (adductor and hamstring)
   
4. **Gracilis**
   - Most superficial, crosses knee
   
5. **Pectineus**
   - Most superior
   - Also hip flexor

### Attachments

**Origin:** Pubic bone
**Insertion:** Along femur (except gracilis to tibia)

## Function

### Primary Actions

**Adduction:**
- Bringing leg to midline
- Crossing legs
- Squeezing knees together

**Hip flexion:**
- Assist when hip is extended

**Hip extension:**
- Assist when hip is flexed
- Adductor magnus significant

### Stability Role

**During single-leg stance:**
- Stabilize pelvis
- Control leg position
- Work with abductors

### Pelvic Floor Connection

- Share attachments at pubic bone
- Co-activate with pelvic floor
- Important for continence

## Common Issues

### Adductor Strains

**Causes:**
- Quick direction changes
- Overstretching
- Weakness
- Poor warm-up

**Prevention:**
- Strengthen through range
- Gradual flexibility work
- Dynamic warm-up

### Tightness

**Effects:**
- Limited hip abduction
- May affect squat width
- Pelvic imbalance

## Exercises

### Strengthening

- Copenhagen plank
- Side-lying adduction
- Adductor squeeze
- Sumo squats
- Lateral lunges

### Stretching

- Butterfly stretch
- Frog stretch
- Side lunge stretch
- Standing adductor stretch
