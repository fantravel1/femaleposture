# Pelvis Anatomy

The pelvis is the foundation of posture, connecting the spine to the legs. Its position affects everything above and below it.

## Bone Structure

### Three Fused Bones (Each Side)

**Ilium:**
- Largest
- Forms hip bone sides
- Iliac crest (palpable)

**Ischium:**
- Posterior/inferior
- "Sit bones"
- Weight-bearing when sitting

**Pubis:**
- Anterior
- Forms pubic symphysis
- Attachment for muscles

### Central Bones

**Sacrum:**
- Base of spine
- 5 fused vertebrae
- Connects to ilia at SI joints

**Coccyx:**
- Tailbone
- Vestigial
- Muscle attachments

## Joints

### Sacroiliac (SI) Joints

**Connecting sacrum to ilia:**
- Limited mobility
- Transfers load
- Can be source of pain

### Pubic Symphysis

**Connecting pubic bones:**
- Cartilaginous joint
- Minimal movement
- Can separate in pregnancy

## Pelvic Position

### Anterior Tilt

**Forward tipping:**
- Increases lumbar lordosis
- Common pattern
- Related to hip flexor tightness

### Posterior Tilt

**Backward tipping:**
- Flattens lumbar curve
- Less common
- Related to weak hip flexors

### Neutral Pelvis

**Ideal position:**
- ASIS and pubic bone vertical
- Natural lumbar curve
- Balanced muscle activity

## Women's Considerations

### Wider Pelvis

**Anatomical difference:**
- For childbirth
- Affects muscle angles
- Different Q-angle at knee

### Pregnancy Effects

**Hormonal and physical changes:**
- Ligament laxity
- SI joint stress
- Altered center of gravity
- Postpartum recovery

## Muscle Attachments

### Connecting to Pelvis

**Many muscles attach here:**
- Hip flexors
- Glutes
- Abdominals
- Back extensors
- Pelvic floor
- Adductors

**Makes pelvic position important for all these muscles**
