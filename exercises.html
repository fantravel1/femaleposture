        <h2>How to Use This Library</h2>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>1. Start with Your Assessment</h3>
          <p>Take our <a href="/tools/posture-self-assessment/">posture self-assessment</a> or <a href="/tools/wall-test/">wall test</a> to identify your specific patterns.</p>

          <h3>2. Pick 3-5 Key Exercises</h3>
          <p>Don't try to do everything. Focus on exercises that target your specific issues. Consistency with a few exercises beats occasional work on many.</p>

          <h3>3. Practice Daily</h3>
          <p>Most posture exercises can be done daily. 10-15 minutes of focused practice creates more change than occasional longer sessions.</p>

          <h3>4. Reassess Monthly</h3>
          <p>Check your progress using the same assessments. Adjust your program as you improve.</p>
