# Retail Worker Posture: Protecting Your Body on the Sales Floor

> **On Your Feet All Day:** Retail is approximately 60% female, and the physical demands are real—standing for 6-12 hour shifts, bending, lifting, and smiling through it all. Your body takes the hit so customers get service.

## The Physical Reality of Retail

### What Retail Workers Do

**Standing:** 6-12 hours, often on concrete
**Bending:** Stocking shelves, picking up merchandise
**Lifting:** Boxes, products, displays
**Reaching:** High shelves, back stock
**Repetitive motions:** Scanning, folding, tagging
**Walking:** Sometimes miles per shift

### Why It Hurts

- Concrete and tile floors are unforgiving
- Footwear restrictions may prevent proper shoes
- No sitting allowed in many positions
- Irregular break schedules
- Heavy lifting expected regardless of size
- Often understaffed = more physical demand per person

### Common Complaints

**Feet and legs:** Aching, swelling, varicose veins
**Lower back:** From standing, bending, lifting
**Shoulders and neck:** From reaching, carrying, register work
**Hands and wrists:** From repetitive scanning, tagging, folding

## Position-Specific Strategies

### Cashier/Register

**The setup:**
- Standing in one position for extended periods
- Repetitive scanning and bagging
- Often leaning or reaching across counter

**Strategies:**
- Anti-fatigue mat at register (request if not provided)
- Shift weight frequently
- Keep items close before scanning
- Use both hands—avoid one-arm reaching
- Vary your bag-loading pattern
- Stretch during slow moments

### Sales Floor

**The demands:**
- Constant walking and standing
- Approaching customers repeatedly
- Bending for merchandise
- Carrying armfuls of clothes/items

**Strategies:**
- Proper footwear is essential
- Use a cart or rack to transport items
- Squat rather than bend when possible
- Take stock of your posture when you're "waiting"
- Keep core engaged while walking

### Stock Room

**The demands:**
- Heavy lifting
- Overhead reaching
- Bending and twisting
- Unpacking and organizing

**Strategies:**
- Use proper lifting technique (legs, not back)
- Use ladders for overhead reaching
- Don't twist while lifting
- Ask for help with heavy items (regardless of expectation)
- Pace yourself—this work is hard

### Fitting Room

**The demands:**
- Constant bending to pick up clothes
- Hanging garments repeatedly
- Walking to return items
- Awkward positions in small spaces

**Strategies:**
- Gather clothes with a squat, not continuous bending
- Use a rolling rack
- Take brief breaks between clean-outs
- Stretch shoulders after hanging sessions

## Standing for Hours: A Survival Guide

### Before Your Shift

**Footwear:**
- The most important investment you can make
- Look for: arch support, cushioning, proper fit
- Break in new shoes before wearing for full shift
- Consider orthotic inserts
- Have two pairs to alternate

**Pre-work prep:**
- Brief stretch routine (5 minutes)
- Calves, hip flexors, lower back
- Hydrate before starting

### During Your Shift

**Movement patterns:**
- Never lock your knees
- Shift weight side to side
- Prop one foot on low step when possible
- Walk whenever you can (moving is better than standing still)
- Avoid crossing arms (leads to hunching)

**Posture cues:**
- Weight on whole foot, not just heels
- Gentle core engagement
- Shoulders back and down
- Head balanced over spine

**Micro-breaks:**
- Every 30-60 minutes, reset your posture
- Calf raises (10) when no one's looking
- Roll shoulders
- Quick hip shift

### After Your Shift

**Recovery routine:**
- Elevate legs for 10-15 minutes
- Ice if swelling
- Gentle stretching: calves, hip flexors
- Roll feet on tennis ball
- Epsom salt soak if possible

## Exercises for Retail Workers

### At Work (Discrete)

**Calf raises:** Stand on toes, lower slowly (when restocking or in back)
**Wall lean:** Shoulders against wall, hold 30 seconds (on break)
**Ankle circles:** While standing, one foot at a time
**Posture reset:** Shoulders back, crown of head up (throughout shift)

### At Home (Recovery)

**Leg wall stretch:**
1. Lie on back, legs up wall
2. Hold 5-10 minutes
3. Reduces swelling, stretches hamstrings

**Hip flexor stretch:**
1. Half-kneeling position
2. Tuck tailbone, lean forward slightly
3. 30 seconds each side

**Cat-cow:**
1. On hands and knees
2. Alternate arching and rounding
3. 10 cycles

**Glute bridges:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Lift hips, squeeze glutes
3. 15-20 reps

### Weekly Strength

**Focus on:**
- Core stability (supports standing)
- Glutes and legs (endurance for standing)
- Upper back (counteracts forward reaching)

**Minimum program:**
- Squats: 3x15
- Glute bridges: 3x15
- Rows or reverse flys: 3x12
- Planks: 3x20 seconds
- 2-3 times per week
