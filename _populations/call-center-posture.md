# Call Center Worker Posture

> **Talk and Type All Day:** Call center work means hours of simultaneous talking and computer use. Protect your voice and your body.

---

## The Call Center Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Extended sitting** - Hours at workstation
- **Headset wear** - All day on head
- **Dual tasking** - Talking while typing
- **Minimal breaks** - High call volume
- **Stress** - Difficult calls, targets
- **Fixed position** - Tethered to desk

### Common Problems

- Neck and shoulder pain
- Lower back strain
- Headset-related headaches
- Wrist issues from typing
- Eye strain from screens
- Stress-related tension

---

## Workstation Setup

### Chair

**Essential:**
- Adjustable height
- Lumbar support
- Armrests that fit under desk
- Comfortable for long hours

**Position:**
- Feet flat on floor (or footrest)
- Back against support
- Not perching on edge
- Relaxed but supported

### Desk and Screen

**Monitor:**
- Eye level (top of screen)
- Arm's length distance
- Directly in front
- No glare

**Keyboard:**
- At elbow height
- Wrists neutral
- Close to bodyld
- Light touch

---

## Headset Ergonomics

### Headset Selection

**Features that matter:**
- Lightweight
- Comfortable ear cushions
- Adjustable fit
- Good quality (reduces straining to hear)
- Wireless if allowed (more movement)

### Wearing Position

**Proper fit:**
- Not too tight
- Not pulling to one side
- Ear pieces comfortable
- Boom mic positioned well

### Alternating Ears

**If single-ear headset:**
- Switch sides periodically
- Reduces one-sided strain
- Balance the wear

---

## Speaking Posture

### Head Position

**During calls:**
- Head balanced on spine
- Not jutting forward
- Neutral neck
- Relaxed jaw

### Voice and Posture

**Connection:**
- Upright posture supports voice
- Slouching affects breathing/voice
- Open chest = better breath support
- Better posture, easier speaking

---

## Typing While Talking

### Dual Task Demands

**The challenge:**
- Looking at screen
- Typing information
- Talking to customer
- Multi-processing

### Positioning

**Setup for both:**
- Screen readable without straining
- Keyboard comfortable while talking
- Not craning forward
- Relaxed shoulders despite activity

---

## Managing High Volume

### Back-to-Back Calls

**The reality:**
- Minimal breaks
- High call counts
- Limited movement
- Burnout risk

### Micro-Movements

**Between calls (even seconds):**
- Shoulder rolls
- Deep breath
- Quick position shift
- Any movement

**If you get breaks:**
- Stand up
- Walk around
- Actual stretching
- Eyes away from screen

---

## Stress and the Body

### Where Call Center Stress Lands

**Common patterns:**
- Jaw clenching (during calls)
- Shoulder tension
- Shallow breathing
- Overall tightness

### Managing Physical Stress

**During calls:**
- Feet grounded
- Conscious breath
- Shoulder drops
- Jaw awareness

**After difficult calls:**
- Shake it out
- Deep breaths
- Brief movement
- Release before next call

---

## Break Time

### If Breaks Are Limited

**Maximum use:**
- Actually get up
- Move body
- Step away from desk
- Don't spend on phone

### Between Shift Sections

**Longer breaks:**
- Walk outside if possible
- Full stretches
- Eat and hydrate
- Physical reset

---

## Quick Stretches

### At Your Desk

**Neck:**
- Chin tucks
- Side tilts
- Gentle rotation

**Shoulders:**
- Rolls backward
- Squeeze shoulder blades
- Shrug and release

**Wrists:**
- Circles both directions
- Flex and extend
- Brief rest from typing

---

## Eye Care

### Screen All Day

**Protection:**
- 20-20-20 rule
- Blink consciously
- Proper screen brightness
- Distance from screen

### End of Shift

**Recovery:**
- Time away from screens
- Rest eyes
- Outdoor time if possible

---

## Building Sustainability

### This Job Is Hard on Bodies

**Recognition:**
- Acknowledge the demands
- Prioritize what you can control
- Self-care matters
- Not your fault if limited

### Off-Work Recovery

**Important:**
