# Accountant and Finance Professional Posture

> **Numbers Don't Wait:** Deadlines, tax seasons, and quarter-ends mean intense computer work. Protect yourself during busy periods and beyond.

---

## The Finance Work Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Extended computer use** - 8-12+ hours during peaks
- **Dual/triple monitors** - Constant head turning
- **Intense focus** - Losing body awareness
- **Deadline pressure** - Skipping breaks
- **Repetitive data entry** - Keyboard and mouse intensive
- **Seasonal intensity** - Tax season, year-end

### Common Problems

- Neck pain from monitor scanning
- Lower back pain from sitting
- Wrist issues from typing
- Eye strain
- Headaches

---

## Multi-Monitor Setup

### The Problem

**Constant scanning between screens:**
- Head turning repeatedly
- Neck strain
- Uneven posture

### Better Setup

**Primary monitor:**
- Directly in front of you
- Eye level
- Where you look most

**Secondary monitors:**
- Angled toward you
- Same height as primary
- Reference material, not primary work

**Position yourself:**
- Centered on main work
- Minimize head turning
- Slight turns, not extreme rotation

---

## Busy Season Survival

### Tax Season / Year-End Reality

**The challenge:**
- 60-80 hour weeks
- Impossible to skip work
- Body pays the price

**Damage control:**

**Setup matters more:**
- Optimize workstation
- Every ergonomic advantage
- Don't add physical strain to mental strain

**Non-negotiable breaks:**
- Even 2 minutes per hour
- Stand and stretch
- Walk to bathroom
- Look away from screen

**Recovery priority:**
- Sleep when you can
- Eat properly
- Quick stretches
- Collapse recovery afterward

## Daily Computer Work

### Keyboard Position

**Heavy clicking and scrolling:**

- Switch hands occasionally

### Document Review

**Paper documents:**

## Posture Reminders

### During Intense Work

**Set reminders:**
- Hourly alarm
- Software prompts
- Apple Watch/fitness tracker
- Whatever works

**Quick checks:**

- Shoulders down?
- Back supported?
- Feet flat?

### End of Day

**Even if you worked 12 hours:**
- Brief stretch
- Walk
- Don't just collapse
- Recovery helps tomorrow
