# Office Workers' Posture Guide

> **Desk-Proof Your Body:** Office workers face unique posture challenges from prolonged sitting and computer use. This guide covers everything you need to know.

---

## The Office Posture Challenge

### What Happens at a Desk

Daily desk work leads to:
- Hours in static positions
- Forward head posture
- Rounded shoulders
- Hip flexor shortening
- Core muscle deactivation
- Reduced circulation

### Why It Matters

Long-term consequences:
- Chronic pain (neck, back, shoulders)
- Postural changes that become harder to correct
- Reduced mobility
- Headaches
- Fatigue

### The Good News

With awareness and action:
- Most problems are preventable
- Many issues are reversible
- Small changes make big differences
- You can feel better

## Workstation Setup

### Monitor Position

**Height:**
- Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- Prevents looking down or up
- Reduces neck strain

**Distance:**
- Arm's length away
- Can read without leaning
- Adjust based on vision needs

**Angle:**
- Slight tilt back acceptable
- No glare (adjust for lighting)
- Directly in front of you

### Keyboard and Mouse

**Keyboard:**
- At elbow height or slightly below
- Allows relaxed shoulders
- Elbows at ~90 degrees
- Wrists neutral (not bent up)

**Mouse:**
- At same level as keyboard
- Close to keyboard (not reaching)
- Use arm to move, not just wrist

### Chair Setup

**Seat height:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Thighs parallel to floor
- Hips at or slightly above knee level

**Back support:**
- Lumbar support at lower back curve
- Recline slightly (100-110 degrees)
- Full contact with backrest

**Armrests:**
- Support arms without raising shoulders
- At elbow height
- Not forcing shoulders up

### Additional Setup

**Footrest:**
- If feet don't reach floor
- Provides support

**Document holder:**
- If frequently referencing papers
- At same height and distance as monitor

---

## Ideal Sitting Posture

### The Basics

**Head and neck:**
- Ears over shoulders
- Chin slightly tucked
- Not craning forward

**Shoulders:**
- Relaxed, not elevated
- Rolled back, not rounded
- Away from ears

**Upper back:**
- Supported by chair
- Gentle curve maintained
- Not slumped

**Lower back:**
- Lumbar curve supported
- Not flattened against chair
- Not excessively arched

**Hips and pelvis:**
- All the way back in chair
- Weight distributed evenly
- Hips at 90-100 degrees

**Legs and feet:**
- Feet flat on floor or footrest
- Knees at ~90 degrees
- Small space behind knees

### Reality Check

**Perfect posture is unrealistic:**
- No one maintains it all day
- Movement matters more
- "Best posture is next posture"
- Variation is healthy

## Standing Desk Considerations

### Benefits

- Reduces sitting time
- Can improve energy
- Allows position variety
- May reduce certain pains

### Not a Complete Solution

- Standing all day isn't ideal either
- Posture matters when standing too
- Movement still essential
- Balance sitting and standing

### How to Use

**Transition gradually:**
- Start with 15-30 minutes standing
- Alternate sit-stand
- Increase gradually
- Listen to your body

**When standing:**
- Weight even on both feet
- Don't lock knees
- Core engaged
- Shift positions frequently

## Laptop-Specific Challenges

### The Problem

Laptops force:
- Looking down (screen too low)
- OR arms reaching up (keyboard too high)
- Compromise position

### Solutions

**At desk:**
- Laptop stand + external keyboard and mouse
- Raises screen to eye level
- Allows proper arm position

**On the go:**
- Limit duration
- Use breaks
- Vary positions
- Consider portable stand
