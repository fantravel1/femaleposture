# Psychologist and Therapist Posture

> **Holding Space Takes a Physical Toll:** Hour after hour of seated sessions, emotional attunement, and note-taking affects your body. Care for yourself too.

---

## The Therapy Work Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Extended sitting** - Back-to-back sessions
- **Attentive posture** - Leaning in, engaged position
- **Static positioning** - Limited movement during sessions
- **Computer documentation** - Before/after sessions
- **Emotional holding** - Tension from content
- **Video sessions** - Different but still demanding

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain from sitting
- Neck and shoulder tension
- Stress-held muscle patterns
- Fatigue from static positions
- Secondary trauma in the body

---

## Session Posture

### The Therapist Lean

**Natural tendency:**
- Lean forward to engage
- Show attentiveness
- Connect with client

**The problem:**
- Sustained forward posture
- Back unsupported
- Strain accumulates

### Balanced Presence

**You can be engaged while supported:**
- Back against chair
- Lean slightly from hips (not rounding spine)
- Feet grounded
- Occasional position shifts okay

---

## Office Setup

### Your Chair

**Critical investment:**
- Quality seating
- Lumbar support
- Comfortable for hours
- Adjustable

**Position:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Back supported
- Arms resting naturally
- Not perching on edge

### Client Seating Arrangement

**Consider your position:**
- Not craning neck to see client
- Natural eye contact angle
- Distance that doesn't require leaning
- Can maintain good posture while engaged

### Video Session Setup

**Screen position:**
- Eye level (camera and screen)
- Not looking down at laptop
- Proper distance
- See [Video Call Posture](/tools/video-call-posture/)

---

## Between Sessions

### Essential Breaks

**Even 5 minutes:**
- Stand up
- Move differently
- Brief stretches
- Reset before next client

### Use Transition Time

**Between clients:**
- Don't stay seated
- Walk to door, stay standing
- Quick stretches
- Movement breaks

### Documentation Strategy

**Notes timing:**
- Brief standing breaks before/after
- Alternate sitting with note-taking
- Voice dictation option
- Don't marathon sit through notes

---

## Emotional Content in the Body

### Where You Hold It

**Common patterns:**
- Shoulder tension from emotional holding
- Jaw clenching during difficult content
- Shallow breathing
- Overall body tension

### During Sessions

**Awareness practices:**
- Notice your own body
- Feet on ground (grounding)
- Conscious breath
- Release tension periodically

### After Difficult Sessions

**Release practices:**
- Shake out body
- Deep breaths
- Brief walk
- Conscious discharge

---

## Self-Care for Providers

- Body awareness
- Professional bodywork

### Preventing Burnout in the Body

---

## Telehealth Considerations

### Different Demands

**Video sessions:**
- Potentially more rigid posture
- Camera awareness
- Different visual focus
- Home office setup variable

### Optimizing Video Work

**Setup:**
- Proper desk ergonomics
- Eye-level camera
- Not hunched over laptop
- Movement between sessions

### Hybrid Practice

**Mixing modalities:**
- Different body demands
- Adjust setup for each
- Movement between formats

---

## Supervision and Meetings

### Group Supervision

**Different seating:**
- May be on different furniture
- Adjust position
- Not passive slouching
- Engaged but supported

### Administrative Time

**Documentation, calls, admin:**
- Standard desk ergonomics apply
- Don't sit all day
- Movement breaks
- Varied positions

---

## Long-Term Practice

### Career Longevity

**This work is sustainable with:**
- Good ergonomics
- Regular self-care
- Physical activity
- Attention to body

### When Providers Need Providers

**See someone if:**
- Persistent pain
- Body reflecting secondary trauma
- Physical symptoms increasing
- Need support (we all do)

---

## Quick Interventions
