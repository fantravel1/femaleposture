# Musician Posture Guide

> **Play for a Lifetime:** Musicians face unique postural challenges based on their instrument. Proper positioning now prevents the career-ending injuries that plague so many players.

---

## Why Musicians Get Hurt

### The Perfect Storm

- **Repetitive motion** - Same movements thousands of times
- **Asymmetric positions** - Many instruments are one-sided
- **Static holds** - Maintaining positions for hours
- **Fine motor precision** - Tension creeps in
- **Practice intensity** - "One more time" mentality
- **Performance stress** - Tension under pressure

### Common Issues

- Neck and upper back pain
- Shoulder problems
- Arm and wrist strain
- Lower back pain
- Hand/finger issues
- Focal dystonia (in severe cases)

---

## Piano and Keyboard

### Seating Position

**Bench height:**
- Forearms parallel to floor or slightly angled down
- Elbows slightly above key level
- Wrists neutral (not dropped or raised)

**Distance from keys:**
- Elbows slightly in front of body
- Full keyboard reachable without leaning
- About forearm's length from fallboard

**Feet:**
- Flat on floor or footrest
- Support your body weight
- Ready for pedals

### Body Position

**Spine:**
- Upright, natural curves
- Slight forward lean from hips (not back)
- Core engaged for support

**Shoulders:**
- Relaxed, not raised
- Not rounded forward
- Free to move with arms

**Arms:**
- Move from shoulder joint
- Elbows free, not pressed to sides
- Wrists follow arm line

### Common Piano Errors

- Sitting too low (wrists collapse)
- Sitting too high (shoulder tension)
- Hunching over keys
- Raised shoulders
- Locked elbows

## Violin and Viola

### Significant Asymmetric Challenges

**Head turn and tilt:**
- Causes neck strain
- Chinrest fit critical
- Shoulder rest essential for most

### Chinrest and Shoulder Rest

**Proper fit means:**
- Head balanced, not clamped
- Minimal head tilt
- Shoulder rest height matching your anatomy
- Neck length determines rest height

**Signs of poor fit:**
- Jaw clamping
- Extreme neck tilt
- Shoulder hiking
- Pain during playing

### Left Arm (Fingerboard)

- Elbow position allows finger reach
- Wrist relatively straight
- Avoid collapsed wrist
- Thumb relaxed on neck

### Right Arm (Bow)

- Shoulder free, not elevated
- Elbow moves freely
- Wrist and fingers flexible
- Avoid death grip on bow

### Standing vs. Sitting

**Standing:**
- Weight balanced
- Knees soft
- Core engaged
- Don't lock back

**Sitting:**
- Edge of chair
- Feet flat
- Upright spine

---

## Guitar (Classical, Acoustic, Electric)

### Classical Position

- Guitar on left thigh (right-handed)
- Footstool elevates thigh
- Neck at 45-degree angle
- Body upright

### Acoustic/Electric Sitting

**With strap:**
- Strap takes weight
- Guitar at consistent position
- Reduces neck craning

**Without strap:**
- Leg position for support
- Avoid hunching over
- Keep guitar at accessible angle

### Standing with Guitar

- Strap height critical
- Guitar not too low (reaching)
- Not too high (cramped)
- Weight distributed

### Hand Positions

**Fretting hand:**
- Thumb behind neck (classical) or wrapped (some styles)
- Wrist relatively straight
- Fingers curved
- Minimal tension

**Picking/strumming:**
- Wrist movement from arm
- Relaxed grip on pick
- Avoid locked wrist

## Wind Instruments

### Breath and Posture Connection

- Posture affects breathing
- Breathing affects sound
- Upright position = better airflow
- Collapsed posture = restricted

### Flute

**Unique challenges:**
- Arms extended to side
- Head turned
- Asymmetric position

**Solutions:**
- Occasional left-handed practice
- Core strength for arm support
- Regular stretching
- Minimize head turn

### Clarinet and Oboe

**Head position:**
- Instrument comes to mouth
- Avoid reaching down
- Neck relatively neutral
- Adjust angle rather than head

### Saxophone

**Weight management:**
- Neck strap takes weight
- Strap adjusted so instrument comes to mouth
- Don't reach down to mouthpiece
- Consider harness for larger saxes

### Brass Instruments

**Holding position:**
- Arms supported when possible
- Instrument at proper angle
- Let the stand do the work
- Mouthpiece to lips, not lips to mouthpiece

---

## Drums and Percussion

### Throne (Seat) Setup

**Height:**
- Thighs angled slightly down
- Easy pedal access
- Stable base

**Position:**
- Centered in kit
- All drums reachable
- Minimal reaching

### Kit Setup

**Arrange for your body:**
- Everything within comfortable reach
- Angles adjusted to you
- Cymbal heights appropriate
- Don't overextend

### Playing Position

- Spine upright
- Shoulders level
- Arms move freely
- Core engaged for power

### Common Drum Errors

- Kit too spread out
- Throne too low
- Tense grip
- Reaching for cymbals

## Practice Habits

### Session Structure

**Warm-up:**
- Body stretches first
- Gentle playing to start
- Don't jump into intense passages

**Practice:**
- Breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Move and stretch between sections
- Rotate difficult material

**Cool-down:**
- Gentle playing to finish
- Stretching afterward
- Note any discomfort

### Time Management

**Building endurance:**
- Increase practice time gradually
- Quality over quantity
- Rest days matter
- Sleep and recovery

### Warning Signs

**Stop and assess if:**
- Pain during playing
- Pain after practice
- Numbness or tingling
- Weakness
- Loss of coordination

## Strengthening for Musicians

### Core

- Essential for all instruments
- Supports arm weight
- Maintains position
- Planks, dead bugs, stability work

### Upper Back

- Counters forward positions
- Rows, Y-T-W raises
- Scapular stability

### Hands and Arms

- Finger independence exercises
- Forearm strength and flexibility
- Wrist stability
- Gradual building

---

## Stretches for Musicians

### Before Playing

**Neck:**
- Gentle rotations
- Side tilts
- Not aggressive

**Shoulders:**
- Circles
- Shrugs
- Across-body stretches

**Wrists and Fingers:**
- Wrist circles
- Finger spreads
- Prayer stretch

### After Playing

**Extended stretches:**
- All the above, longer holds
- Chest opener
- Upper back stretch
- Forearm stretches

## Performance Considerations

### Pre-Performance

- Full warm-up
- Mental preparation
- Physical readiness
- Tension awareness

### During Performance

- Maintain good habits
- Breathing awareness
- Release tension between pieces
- Grounded position

### Post-Performance

- Cool-down stretches
- Recovery before next performance
- Note any issues
