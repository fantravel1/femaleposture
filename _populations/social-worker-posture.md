# Social Worker Posture and Body Care

> **Field, Office, and Everything Between:** Social work means varied environments, extensive driving, heavy caseloads, and physical demands that often go unrecognized.

---

## The Social Work Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Home visits** - Variable environments
- **Extensive driving** - Between clients, agencies
- **Office documentation** - Computer-intensive work
- **Heavy bags/materials** - Carrying case files, resources
- **Unpredictable situations** - Adapting constantly
- **Emotional labor** - Physical manifestation of stress

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain (sitting, driving, variable seating)
- Neck and shoulder tension
- Hip tightness from driving
- Fatigue from varied demands
- Stress-related physical symptoms

---

## Home Visits

### Variable Seating

**The reality:**
- Sitting wherever available
- Soft couches, hard chairs, floors
- Not ergonomic anything
- Extended conversations in poor positions

**Strategies:**
- Sit more upright when possible
- Feet flat on ground
- Core engagement (gentle)
- Position changes when appropriate
- Accept some situations are temporary

### Low Seating

**When on floor or low furniture:**
- Keep visits reasonable length
- Shift positions
- Support back against something if possible
- Know it's temporary

### Standing Options

**Sometimes better:**
- Brief visits while standing
- Lean on something stable
- Weight shifting
- May be more appropriate anyway

---

## Driving Demands

### Extensive Time in Car

**Between visits:**
- Hours of driving possible
- Car seat not designed for this
- Accumulated strain

### Car Ergonomics

**Optimize your seat:**
- Lumbar support (add cushion)
- Proper seat distance
- Mirrors set for good posture
- Steering wheel position

**During driving:**
- Vary hand positions
- Periodic movement
- Stop for longer drives

**Between visits:**
- Get out of car
- Brief stretch
- Movement break
- Don't just sit in car for next call

## Office Time

- Keyboard, chair height
- Not ideal but possible

### Breaking Up Sitting

**Throughout day:**

## Carrying Materials

### The Heavy Bag

**Common contents:**
