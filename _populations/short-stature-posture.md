# Short Stature Posture Guide

> **Standard Sizing Wasn't Made for You:** Desks too high, chairs too big, counters at wrong height—petite women face unique ergonomic challenges.

---

## The Petite Challenge

### What Standard Means

**Equipment designed for:**
- Average or larger frames
- Taller heights
- Bigger proportions
- Not you

### Common Struggles

**Daily challenges:**
- Chairs don't adjust low enough
- Desks too high
- Feet dangling
- Reaching for everything
- Counters at wrong height

---

## Workspace Adaptations

### Chair Issues

**Common problems:**
- Lowest setting still too high
- Seat depth too long
- Armrests don't fit under desk
- Back support doesn't hit right

**Solutions:**
- Petite-sized office chairs exist
- Footrest essential
- Back cushion to fill gap
- Consider seat cushion positioning

### Footrest Necessity

**When feet don't reach:**
- Footrest required (not optional)
- Adjustable height
- Angled can help
- Reduces leg pressure

### Desk Height

**Often too high:**
- Raises shoulders to type
- Creates neck tension
- Arms elevated

**Solutions:**

- Adjustable desk if possible
- Chair at proper height + footrest
- Lower desk surface if option

---

## Monitor Positioning

### Standard Position Too High

**When monitor at "eye level" isn't:**
- Top of screen may be too high
- Standard arm positions too high

- Eyes at upper third of screen
- Low monitor arm or stand
- Remove monitor stand risers

## Reaching Issues

### Daily Reaching

**Challenges:**
- High shelves

- Standard storage heights
- Reaching creates strain

**Strategies:**

- Don't overreach
- Ask for help when needed

---

## Kitchen and Home

### Counter Heights

**Often too tall:**
- Shoulders raised while working
- Arm strain
- Back compensation

**Solutions:**
- Stepping stool at counter
- Lower work surfaces when possible
- Island at different height if renovating
- Adjust tasks to fit space

### Cabinets and Storage

**Upper cabinets especially:**

**Strategies:**

- Quality step stool
- Reorganize for access
- Accept reaching limitations

---

## Driving Adaptations

### Vehicle Fit

**Common issues:**
- Seat too far from pedals
- Steering wheel position
- Mirror visibility

**Solutions:**
- Seat adjusted fully forward

- Cushion for height if needed safely

---

## Clothing and Equipment

### Bag Straps

**Often too long:**
- Crossbody hits at wrong height

- Shoulder straps slide

**Solutions:**

### Exercise Equipment

**Standard may not fit:**

**Strategies:**

## Posture Awareness

### Overcompensation

**May develop:**
- Reaching up constantly
- Straining to see
- Compensation patterns

### Confidence and Posture

**Standing tall matters:**
- Good posture at any height
- Not compensating to appear taller
- Natural, confident stance
- Your height is fine

---

## Shoe Considerations

### Heel Choices

**Height temptation:**
- Higher heels change posture
- Can cause problems
- Not necessary
- Your choice

### Flat Considerations

**If choosing flats:**
- Supportive options
- Proper cushioning
- Not sacrificing foot health
- Good posture in any shoe height

---

## Working with Healthcare

### Smaller Frame Considerations

**Providers should know:**
- Standard equipment may not fit
- Examination tables challenging
- Weight-based dosing different

---

## Advocacy

### Workplace Ergonomics

**Request:**

- Equipment that fits

### Right to Comfort

**You deserve:**
- Workstation that fits
- Equipment that works for you
