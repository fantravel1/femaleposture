# Bartender and Server Posture

> **The Hospitality Hustle:** Long shifts on hard floors, carrying heavy trays, constant bending and reaching—restaurant and bar work is physically demanding. Protect your body.

---

## Hospitality Work Challenges

### Physical Demands

- **8-12 hour shifts** on feet
- **Carrying heavy trays** - often one-handed
- **Constant walking** - miles per shift
- **Reaching and bending** - bars, tables, supplies
- **Speed pressure** - rushed movements
- **Lifting kegs, cases** - heavy loads
- **Awkward bar heights** - reaching over counter

### Common Problems

- Foot and leg fatigue
- Lower back pain
- Shoulder strain (tray carrying)
- Wrist issues
- Neck tension

---

## Standing All Shift

### Basics

**Good standing posture:**
- Weight even on both feet
- Knees soft, not locked
- Core gently engaged
- Shoulders back

### Reality of Service

**You're constantly moving, but:**
- Shift weight when standing still
- Don't lock knees
- Engage core during lifting
- Quick posture resets between tables

### Footwear Is Critical

**What to look for:**
- Non-slip soles (essential)
- Arch support
- Cushioning
- Proper fit
- Comfortable for 8+ hours

**Replace:**
- When cushioning fails
- When support breaks down
- Every 6-12 months with heavy use

### Floor Surfaces

**Anti-fatigue mats:**
- Behind bar if possible
- At service stations
- Make significant difference
- Advocate for them

---

## Carrying Trays

### The One-Arm Challenge

**Tray carrying strains:**
- Shoulder and upper back
- Wrist
- Creates imbalance

### Better Technique

**Loading tray:**
- Heavy items centered
- Balance before lifting
- Don't overload

**Lifting:**
- Get under tray, palm flat
- Lift with arm, not wrist flip
- Keep arm close to body

**Carrying:**
- Shoulder down (not hiked)
- Core engaged
- Walk with purpose
- Steady, not rushing

**Unloading:**
- Lower carefully
- Use surface to support
- Bend at knees if reaching low

### Switching Sides

- Alternate carrying arm when possible
- Balance the workload
- Build strength on both sides

---

## Bartending Specific

### Bar Height Issues

**Reaching over bar:**
- Creates forward bend
- Repeated thousands of times

**Solutions:**
- Step closer when possible
- Face task squarely
- Use proper reaching technique
- Move feet, don't just reach

### Repetitive Tasks

**Shaking, pouring, muddling:**
- Same motions repeatedly
- Wrist and arm strain

**Prevention:**
- Vary hand use when possible
- Stretches during shifts
- Efficient, not forceful movements

### Lifting Bottles and Kegs

**Bottles:**
- Lighter lifts but repetitive
- Organize for efficiency
- Speed rack at accessible height

**Kegs:**
- Very heavy—get help
- Proper lifting technique
- Use dolly/hand truck
- Don't be a hero

---

## Server Specific

### Table Service

**Bending to tables:**
- Squat or half-kneel, don't bend at waist
- Get close before reaching
- Serve from stable position

**Clearing tables:**
- Don't overload arms
- Stack plates carefully
- Multiple trips are okay
- Use bus tubs

### Tray Jacks/Stands

**If available:**
- Use them
- Reduces carrying
- Makes serving easier

---

## During the Shift

### Pacing Yourself

**If possible:**
- Vary tasks
- Rotate positions
- Move consistently (avoid standing still)

### Microbreaks

**Quick resets:**
- Shoulder rolls
- Ankle circles
- Neck stretches
- Back extension

### Staying Fueled

- Eat staff meal (don't skip)
- Stay hydrated
- Energy affects posture

---

## Between Rushes

### Quick Stretches

**Back:**
- Standing back extension
- Torso twists

**Legs:**
- Calf raises
- Quad stretch

**Shoulders:**
- Arm across body
- Shoulder rolls

**Wrists:**
- Circles
- Flexion/extension stretches

---

## End of Shift

### Cool Down

**Take time to:**
- Stretch thoroughly
- Walk down before leaving
- Don't just collapse

### Recovery

- Elevate legs
- Hot shower/bath
- Gentle stretching
- Adequate sleep

---

## Building Resilience

### Fitness Matters

**Key areas:**
- Core strength (essential)
- Leg endurance
- Upper body strength
- Flexibility

### Off Days

- Active recovery (not just resting)
- Stretching
- Address any pain
- Don't neglect fitness

---

## Common Mistakes

- Locking knees when standing
- Carrying tray too high or awkward
- Bending at waist not knees
- Wearing unsupportive shoes
- Ignoring pain

---

## When to Get Help
