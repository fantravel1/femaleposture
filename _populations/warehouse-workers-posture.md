# Warehouse Worker Posture Guide

> **Protecting Your Body in a Physical Job:** Warehouse work is demanding—constant lifting, bending, and moving. The right techniques can prevent injuries that end careers.

---

## The Warehouse Reality

### Physical Demands

- **Repeated lifting** - Hundreds of lifts per shift
- **Varied loads** - Light to very heavy
- **Bending** - Low shelves, floor level work
- **Reaching** - High shelves, deep shelving
- **Carrying** - Distances vary
- **Pushing/pulling** - Carts, pallets
- **Standing** - Concrete floors

### Common Injuries

- Lower back strain (most common)
- Shoulder injuries
- Knee problems
- Hernias
- Cumulative trauma

---

## Lifting Fundamentals

### Every Lift Matters

**Before lifting:**
1. Assess the load (weight, size, shape)
2. Plan your path
3. Clear obstacles
4. Get help if needed

**The lift:**
1. Stand close to load
2. Feet shoulder-width, one slightly ahead
3. Squat down, bending at hips and knees
4. Grip securely
5. Brace core
6. Lift with legs
7. Keep load close
8. Don't twist

**Setting down:**
- Reverse the process
- Squat, don't bend
- Control the descent

### Weight Limits

**Know your limits:**
- Company guidelines
- Personal capacity
- Ask for help rather than risking injury
- Use equipment when available

**Warning signs:**
- If you have to hold your breath
- If your form breaks down
- If you feel strain
- It's too heavy

---

## Working at Different Heights

### Floor Level

**The challenge:**
- Lowest point = most strain
- Repeated bending is damaging

**Technique:**
- Full squat or half-kneel
- One knee down for extended work
- Don't bend at waist with straight legs
- Alternate kneeling legs

### Mid-Level (Waist to Shoulder)

**Best zone:**
- Least strain
- Keep heavy items here when possible
- Organize for efficiency

### Overhead

**The challenge:**
- Reduced strength
- Balance issues
- Shoulder strain

**Technique:**
- Use step stool for heavy items
- Don't reach with heavy loads
- Keep items close to body
- Use two people if needed

---

## Pushing and Pulling

### Cart and Pallet Work

**Push rather than pull:**
- More power
- Better posture
- Can see where going

**Technique:**
- Keep load close
- Push at waist height
- Use whole body, not just arms
- Short steps

**Starting heavy loads:**
- Lean in with body weight
- Start slow
- Build momentum

### Equipment Use

**Pallet jacks:**
- Pump to right height
- Keep clear of path
- Control speed
- Use proper technique

**Forklifts:**
- Sit with good posture
- Vibration awareness
- Take breaks

---

## Carrying Loads

### Proper Carrying

**Position:**
- Load close to body
- Arms close
- Balanced weight
- Core engaged

**Movement:**
- Short, quick steps
- Don't rush
- Watch footing
- Clear path

### Awkward Items

**Long items:**
- Balance point
- Keep level
- Watch ends
- Two-person when needed

**Unbalanced loads:**
- Redistribute if possible
- Heavier side closer to body
- Extra caution

---

## Standing on Concrete

### The Problem

- Hard surfaces cause fatigue
- Standing all day = leg and back pain
- Poor circulation

### Solutions

**Footwear:**
- Quality work boots/shoes
- Cushioned insoles
- Replace when worn
- Arch support

**Mats:**
- Anti-fatigue mats at stations
- Advocate for proper flooring

**Movement:**
- Shift weight
- Walk when possible
- Stretch regularly

---

## Throughout the Shift

### Pacing

**Early shift:**
- Body is fresh
- Good time for heavier work
- Establish rhythm

**Mid-shift:**
- Fatigue setting in
- Be more careful
- Take proper breaks

**End of shift:**
- Highest injury risk
- Fatigue causes poor form
- Extra attention to technique

### Breaks

**Use breaks for:**
- Sitting (rest legs)
- Stretching
- Hydrating
- Mental reset

**Don't skip breaks:**
- Required for recovery
- Reduce injury risk
- Maintain performance

---

## Stretches for Warehouse Workers

### Quick Stretches (1-2 Minutes)

**Lower back:**
- Standing back extension
- Hands on low back, lean back
- 10 seconds

**Hips:**
- Standing hip flexor stretch
- Step back into lunge
- 20 seconds each leg

**Hamstrings:**
- Foot on low surface
- Lean forward slightly
- 20 seconds each leg

**Shoulders:**

- 20 seconds each arm

### Before Shift

- 5-minute warm-up

## Building Strength

### Key Exercises

**Legs:**
- Squats (you do them all day)
- Lunges
- Stronger legs = easier lifting

**Back:**

## When to Stop

### Injury Warning Signs
