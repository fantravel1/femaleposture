# Veterinarian and Vet Tech Posture

> **Caring for Animals, Protecting Yourself:** Veterinary work combines unpredictable patients with challenging physical demands. Lifting, restraining, and treating animals takes a toll on your body.

---

## Unique Challenges of Veterinary Work

### Physical Demands

- **Animal handling** - Unpredictable, varying sizes
- **Lifting** - Patients of all weights
- **Restraint** - Holding for procedures
- **Surgery** - Long periods in fixed positions
- **Bending** - Exam tables often too low
- **Floor work** - Large animal, fear-free handling

### Unpredictability Factor

- Animals move unexpectedly
- Bracing against resistance
- Sudden bursts of strength
- Can't fully plan each interaction

---

## Animal Handling

### Small Animals

**Lifting dogs:**
- Assess weight before lifting
- Get help for large dogs (>40-50 lbs)
- Keep animal close to body
- Squat, don't bend
- Use lifts/ramps when available

**Restraint:**
- Get comfortable position first
- Use minimal restraint needed
- Distribute effort across body
- Take breaks when possible
- Trade off with colleagues

**Floor handling (fear-free):**
- Kneel rather than bend
- Use cushioned knee pad
- Change positions frequently
- Support your back

### Large Animals

**Additional challenges:**
- Can't lift—must work with animal
- More awkward positions
- Higher injury risk

**Safety principles:**
- Proper facilities and equipment
- Position yourself safely
- Escape routes planned
- Never get between animal and wall

---

## Examination and Treatment

### Exam Table Height

**The problem:**
- Most tables are too low
- Constant bending forward
- Neck and back strain

**Solutions:**
- Height-adjustable tables
- Hydraulic lift tables
- Step stools for tall staff
- Advocate for proper equipment

### During Exams

**Position:**
- Stand close to table
- Adjust table to your height if possible
- Core engaged
- Switch sides when possible

**Avoid:**
- Leaning over for extended periods
- Twisting to reach supplies
- Hunching over patients

### Treatment Procedures

**Blood draws, injections, etc.:**
- Comfortable position before starting
- Animal properly restrained
- Everything ready and accessible
- Adequate lighting

## Surgery

### Surgical Suite Ergonomics

**Table height:**
- Adjust for your height
- Elbows at comfortable angle
- Not reaching up or hunching down

**Positioning:**
- Stand squarely
- Both feet planted
- Don't lean to one side
- Core engaged

### Long Surgeries

**Managing fatigue:**
- Shift weight periodically
- Micro-movements when possible
- Anti-fatigue mat
- Supportive shoes

**Breaks:**
- Between procedures
- Stretch and move
- Don't schedule back-to-back long surgeries

### Loupes and Microscopes

**If you use them:**
- Proper declination angle
- Custom fit for your anatomy
- Reduce neck flexion
- See dental professional guidance (similar issues)

## Imaging

### X-Ray Positioning

**Challenges:**
- Holding animals in position
- Awkward angles
- Lead protection adds weight

**Technique:**
- Minimal manual restraint when possible
- Use positioning aids

### Ultrasound

**Long exams:**
- Seated when possible

## Throughout the Day

### Pacing

**If possible:**
- Mix appointment types
- Alternate physical and less physical

### Microbreaks

**Between appointments:**
- Stand and stretch
- Shoulder rolls
- Neck movement
- Back extensions

### Team Approach

- Share physically demanding work
- Help each other with large animals
- Communicate about fatigue
- Don't be a hero
