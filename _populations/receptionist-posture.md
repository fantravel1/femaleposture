# Receptionist and Front Desk Posture

> **The Hub of Activity:** Front desk work combines extended sitting with constant interruptions, phone handling, and customer interaction. Your workstation setup and habits matter enormously.

---

## Front Desk Challenges

### Unique Demands

- **Extended sitting** - Often 8+ hours
- **Phone work** - Holding, cradling, reaching
- **Divided attention** - Screen and people
- **Fixed position** - Can't always get up
- **Varied tasks** - Typing, filing, greeting
- **Counter height** - May not match your body

### Common Problems

- Neck pain from phone use
- Lower back pain from sitting
- Shoulder strain from reaching
- Wrist issues from typing position
- Eye strain from screen glare

---

## Workstation Setup

### Desk Height and Position

**Chair height:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Thighs parallel to floor
- Elbows at desk level

**Keyboard and mouse:**
- At elbow height
- Close to body
- Wrists neutral

**Monitor:**
- Eye level (top of screen)
- Arm's length away
- Angled away from glare

### The Reception Counter

**If counter is too high:**
- Raise chair (use footrest)
- Request adjustment if possible
- Advocate for proper fit

**If counter is too low:**
- Difficult to fix
- May need creative solutions
- Discuss with management

---

## Phone Ergonomics

### The Phone Problem

**Cradling phone on shoulder:**
- Major neck strain
- Uneven muscle tension
- Repetitive injury risk
- Must be avoided

### Solutions

**Headset:**
- Essential for frequent calls
- Wireless allows movement
- Worth advocating for
- Significant pain prevention

**Speakerphone:**
- When privacy allows
- Frees hands
- Better than cradling

**Proper holding:**
- If must hold phone
- Switch hands frequently
- Don't cradle ever
- Keep calls brief

---

## Managing Interruptions

### The Position Challenge

**Constant turning:**
- To greet visitors
- Back to screen
- Repeat all day
- Creates twisting strain

### Better Setup

**Position for visibility:**
- Arrange so you can see entrance
- Minimize turning needed
- Swivel chair helps
- Face forward as default

**Greeting posture:**
- Swivel whole chair to face person
- Don't just twist neck/torso
- Return to centered position

---

## Sitting All Day

### The Reality

- May not be able to leave desk
- Breaks limited
- Movement restricted
- Need strategies that work within constraints

### What You Can Do

**At your desk:**
- Seated stretches
- Ankle circles
- Shoulder rolls
- Neck stretches
- Posture resets

**When possible:**
- Stand during quiet moments
- Walk to deliver things
- Take full lunch break
- Use bathroom breaks for movement

### Micro-Movements

**Small motions that help:**
- Shift in chair
- Engage and release core
- Squeeze and release glutes
- Move within your space

---

## Computer Work

### Typing Position

- Keyboard flat or slightly negative tilt
- Wrists neutral (not bent up)
- Fingers curved
- Light touch

### Mouse Use

- Close to keyboard
- Move from shoulder not wrist
- Alternate hands if possible
- Consider trackpad

### Screen Position

- Directly in front
- Eye level
- No glare
- Appropriate brightness

---

## Filing and Reaching

### Minimizing Strain

**Frequently used items:**
- Within arm's reach
- Not requiring standing and stretching

**Filing cabinets:**
- Squat for low drawers
- Stand fully for high
- Don't bend and twist

**Supplies:**
- Organize for efficiency
- Keep essentials close
- Reduce unnecessary reaching

---

## Managing Visitors

### Counter Interactions

**Height considerations:**
- Counter may create awkward height
- Don't strain to see over or around
- Adjust seating if needed

**Reaching to hand items:**
- Stand if needed
- Don't overreach
- Step to convenient distance

---

## Multi-Tasking Challenges

### Attention Divided

**Computer + phone + visitors:**
- Creates posture chaos
- Focus on one thing when possible
- Reset position between tasks

### Task Switching

**Use transitions:**
- Quick posture check between calls
- Reset after visitor interaction
- Don't stay frozen in awkward positions

---
