# Entrepreneur and Startup Founder Posture

> **Building a Business on Your Body:** Startup life demands everything—including your physical health. Don't sacrifice your body for your vision.

---

## The Entrepreneur Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **All hours** - No work-life boundaries
- **Any location** - Coffee shops, home, wherever
- **Limited resources** - No ergonomic office
- **Multiple roles** - Everything falls on you
- **High stress** - Constant pressure
- **Neglected self-care** - Business comes first

### Common Problems

- Poor makeshift workstation setups
- Long hours in bad positions
- Stress-related tension
- Neglected physical health
- Burnout manifesting physically

## Makeshift Workspace Realities

### Coffee Shop Office

**Common but problematic:**

- Wrong table heights
- Laptop at low position

**Making it work:**
- Choose locations with better seating
- Bring laptop stand (portable)
- Limit duration
- Mix locations

### Home Office on Budget

**Starting lean:**
- Kitchen table
- Basic chair
- Laptop only

**Upgrading smartly:**
- Invest in chair first
- Then monitor/laptop stand
- Build proper setup gradually
- Health is business asset

## The Hustle Culture Problem

### "Sleep When You're Dead"

**The myth:**
- Constant work = success
- Self-care is weakness
- Body can wait
- Push through everything

**The reality:**
- Burnout crashes businesses
- Health problems derail founders
- Sustainable pace wins
- Your body IS your startup
