# Real Estate Agent Posture

> **Always on the Move:** Real estate work means driving between showings, standing during open houses, working from your car, and wearing professional shoes for hours. Here's how to protect your body.

---

## The Real Estate Physical Challenge

### Unique Demands

- **Extensive driving** - Property to property
- **Standing for showings** - Often on hard floors
- **Walking tours** - Multiple properties daily
- **Mobile office** - Car, coffee shops, random spaces
- **Professional appearance** - Heels, dress shoes
- **Carrying materials** - Signs, lockboxes, documents
- **Unpredictable schedule** - Long days, variable hours

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain from driving
- Foot fatigue from standing/walking
- Neck strain from car phone use

---

## Car as Office

### Driving Between Showings

**Seat setup:**
- Proper lumbar support
- Seat at right height
- Mirrors adjusted
- Comfortable reaching wheel

**See:** [Driving Posture](/activities/driving/)

### Working in the Car

**Avoid:**
- Working on laptop in driver's seat
- Extended phone use in car
- Hunching over paperwork

**Better:**
- Find proper seating (coffee shop, office)
- Use phone stand if needed
- Take breaks between drives

### Phone Calls While Driving

- Bluetooth essential
- Don't cradle phone
- Short calls only
- Pull over for important calls

## During Showings

### Walking Property Tours

**Footwear dilemma:**
- Need professional appearance
- But walking extensively

**Solutions:**
- Most supportive professional shoes possible
- Low heels or stylish flats
- Change shoes between properties if possible
- Keep comfortable shoes in car

### Standing While Clients Browse

**Use the time:**
- Shift weight
- Walk slowly through space
- Don't lock knees
- Posture awareness

### Climbing Stairs

- Use handrails
- Pace yourself
- Multiple properties means many stairs
- Cardio matters

---

## Open Houses

### Hours of Standing

**Setup:**
- Wear comfortable shoes (within professional range)
- Anti-fatigue mat at station if possible
- Plan to move around

**During:**
- Walk the property between visitors
- Shift positions
- Sit when appropriate
- Stretch when alone

### Greeting Visitors

- Face people squarely
- Don't twist to greet
- Stand with good posture
- Relaxed but engaged

---

## Carrying Real Estate Materials

### Signs and Lockboxes

**Lifting:**
- Proper technique
- Get close before lifting
- Lift with legs
- Don't twist

**Carrying:**
- Balanced loads
- Multiple trips if needed
- Use car as staging

### Document Bags and Materials

- Crossbody or backpack better than shoulder bag
- Keep weight reasonable
- Distribute between hands
- Don't overload

---

## Mobile Work Ergonomics

### Coffee Shop Working

**Make it work:**
- Choose seating carefully
- Sit with back support
- Device at reasonable height
- Time limit (1-2 hours)

### Client Meetings in Various Locations

- Sit properly wherever you are
- Posture awareness even in casual settings

### Car Paperwork

**If you must:**
- Brief sessions only
- Get out and stretch
- Find proper space for extended work

## Footwear Strategy

### The Heel Problem

**Professional vs. practical:**
- Heels required for showings
- But walking and standing all day

### Solutions

**Lower heels:**
- 1-2 inches maximum
- Block heels more stable
- Stylish doesn't mean sky-high

**Shoe switching:**
- Comfortable driving shoes
- Change for showings
- Backup flats in car

**Supportive options:**
- Quality insoles
- Brands with hidden support
- Well-fitted shoes
