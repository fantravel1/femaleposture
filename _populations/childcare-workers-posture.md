# Childcare Worker Posture Guide

> **Caring for Little Ones Takes a Toll:** Lifting babies, bending to toddler height, sitting on tiny chairs, and being on the floor all day creates significant physical strain. Here's how to protect yourself while caring for children.

---

## The Childcare Challenge

### What Makes It Hard

- **Constant lifting** - Babies, toddlers, equipment
- **Low surfaces** - Everything is child-sized
- **Floor time** - Extended periods on the ground
- **Carrying children** - Often on one hip
- **Diaper changes** - Repeated bending
- **Chasing** - Sudden movements, bending, catching
- **Emotional/physical drain** - Full body and mind engagement

### Common Injuries

- Lower back pain (most common)
- Shoulder strain
- Knee problems
- Neck pain
- Wrist/arm strain from carrying

---

## Lifting Children Safely

### Infants (0-12 months)

**From crib/floor:**
1. Get as close as possible
2. Widen your stance
3. Squat or half-kneel
4. Bring baby close before lifting
5. Stand using your legs

**To put down:**
- Reverse the process
- Squat or half-kneel to lower
- Don't bend at waist

### Toddlers (1-3 years)

**Critical time - heaviest relative to handling:**

**From floor:**
1. Squat down to their level
2. Have child face you
3. Let them "help" by holding on
4. Lift with legs, keeping close

**When they want "up":**
- Teach them to face you
- Squat to their level
- Lift from squat
- Don't bend and scoop

### Preschoolers (3-5 years)

**Usually don't need lifting, but:**
- If injured or upset, same principles
- Encourage climbing up to you
- Use step stools
- Limit carrying

---

## Carrying Children

### The Hip Carry Problem

**Most common—and most harmful:**
- All weight on one hip
- Spine curves to compensate
- Repeated = injury

**If you must:**
- Switch sides constantly
- Limit duration
- Center carry when possible

### Better Carrying Options

**Center carry:**
- Child facing you
- Weight centered
- Arms supporting
- Less strain

**Child carriers:**
- For infants: proper carrier with waist belt
- Distribute weight to hips
- Use both straps
- See [Baby Carrying Posture](/tools/baby-carrying-posture/)

---

## Diaper Changes

### The Repeated Bending Problem

**Many times per day × many children = significant strain**

### Solutions

**Changing table height:**
- Should be at waist height
- Elbows at 90 degrees
- No bending forward

**If table is too low:**
- Request adjustment
- Use risers
- Advocate for proper equipment

**Technique:**
- Stand close to table
- Face the table squarely
- Don't twist to reach supplies
- Everything within arm's reach

---

## Working at Child Height

### Low Tables and Chairs

**The problem:**
- Adult bodies don't fit
- Constant flexion
- Extended periods

**Solutions:**
- Sit on adult-sized chair at children's table
- Squat or kneel instead of sitting
- Limit time in tiny chairs
- Use cushion for tailbone

### Floor Activities

**Make it work:**
- Vary your floor position frequently
- Use cushions under knees
- Cross-legged, side-sitting, kneeling—alternate
- Get up regularly

**Positions to use:**
- Cross-legged (switch which leg is on top)
- One knee up, one down
- Side-sitting (switch sides)
- Kneeling with cushion
- Lying on stomach briefly (for baby play)

---

## Meal and Snack Time

### Feeding Infants

- Hold at comfortable height
- Support your arm with pillow
- Switch arms for bottles
- Sit in supportive chair

### Feeding Toddlers

- Don't bend to their table
- Kneel or use adult chair
- Position yourself, not just them

### Cleanup

- Squat to wipe tables at child height
- Don't bend repeatedly
- Use long-handled cleaning tools when possible

---

## Classroom Management

### Setup and Cleanup

**Toy bins:**
- Store at waist height when possible
- Squat to reach low storage
- Don't bend at waist repeatedly

**Moving furniture:**
- Push, don't pull
- Use wheels when possible
- Get help for heavy items
- Slide, don't lift

### Reading Time

**If on floor:**
- Back against wall if possible
- Vary position
- Use cushion

**Better options:**
- Child-sized couch you can fit
- Adult-sized rocker
- Elevated reading area

---

## Playground and Outdoor Time

### Active Play

- Bend at knees to engage
- Squat rather than bend
- Be careful on climbing structures
- Watch footing

### Pushing Swings

- Stand to the side
- Use whole body, not just arms
- Don't twist

### Catching/Lifting

- Be prepared for sudden grabs
- Squat to their level
- Brace core before lifting

---

## Nap Time

### Putting Children Down

**Cribs:**
- Lower the side

- Don't bend over side

**Cots:**

### Soothing/Patting

## Daily Strategies

### Pacing Yourself

- Rotate heavy-lifting tasks
- Rest when children nap

- Don't be a hero

### Microbreaks

**Every 30 minutes:**
- Stand up straight
