> **Stand Tall:** Being tall comes with unique posture challenges. The world isn't designed for you, but with the right strategies, you can maintain excellent posture and feel confident in your height.

## Unique Posture Challenges for Tall Women

### The Slouching Habit

Many tall women unconsciously:
- Slouch to appear shorter
- Hunch to fit into social situations
- Round shoulders to minimize presence
- Bend neck to make eye contact

This often starts in adolescence and becomes ingrained.

### The World Isn't Built for You

Standard equipment is too small:
- Desks too low
- Chairs too short
- Counters at wrong height
- Doorframes to duck under
- Cars with insufficient headroom

### Longer Levers

Taller body means:
- More force required to maintain posture
- Greater moment arms on spine
- More challenge for core muscles
- Higher potential for strain
