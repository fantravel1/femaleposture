# Flight Attendant Posture and Body Care

> **Working at 35,000 Feet:** Confined spaces, heavy carts, overhead bins, and cabin pressure create unique physical demands. Protect your body throughout your career.

---

## The Flight Attendant Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Confined workspace** - Narrow aisles, galleys
- **Heavy lifting** - Luggage, carts, supplies
- **Awkward positions** - Overhead bins, low galleys
- **Standing and walking** - Hours on hard surfaces
- **Serving** - Bending, reaching, twisting
- **Cabin pressure** - Dehydration, swelling, fatigue

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain
- Shoulder injuries
- Neck strain
- Foot and leg problems
- Joint stiffness
- Fatigue-related poor posture

---

## Overhead Bin Safety

### The Risk

**Lifting overhead:**
- Shoulder strain
- Back injury
- Falling luggage
- Awkward angles

### Protective Techniques

**When helping passengers:**
- Ask about weight first
- Get help for heavy bags
- Don't catch falling items
- Know your limits

**Your own technique:**
- Use step (if available)
- Lift to waist first
- Then to bin level
- Push in, don't throw

**Say no when needed:**
- You're not required to injure yourself
- Heavy bags need passenger handling
- Gate check is an option

## Cart Service

### The Challenge

**Heavy carts:**
- Pushing and pulling
- Narrow aisles
- Turbulence
- Repetitive bending

### Better Technique

**Pushing:**
- Keep cart close
- Push from core, not arms
- Don't overreach
- Watch for aisle obstacles

**Serving:**
- Face your work
- Don't twist while serving
- Move feet, not back
- Bend knees for low items

**Lifting items:**
- Keep close to body
- Lift with legs
- One item at a time
- Stack mindfully

## Galley Work

### Confined Space

**Galley challenges:**
- Limited room
- Reaching and bending
- Hard surfaces
- Tight turns

### Positioning

**When working:**
- Face your task
- Move feet to face different directions
- Don't twist repeatedly
- Use all available space

**During prep:**
- Comfortable stance
- Anti-fatigue stance (shift weight)
- Flat comfortable shoes

## In-Flight Posture

### Jump Seat Time

**During takeoff/landing:**
- Sit tall
- Feet flat
