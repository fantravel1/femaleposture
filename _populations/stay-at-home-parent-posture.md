## Child Lifting and Carrying

### Infants

**Lifting from crib/floor:**
- Get close
- Bend knees
- Keep baby close
- Lift with legs

**Carrying:**
- Alternate sides
- Use carrier properly
- Close to body
- Don't always favor one hip

### Toddlers

**The constant "up":**
- Squat to their level
- Have them climb when possible
- Alternate arms
- Know when to say no

**Carrying heavier children:**
- Consider limit for carrying
- Legs, not back
- Don't twist while holding
- Put down to move

### Car Seats

**Lifting in and out:**
- Don't reach across
- Get as close as possible
- Support your back
- Lift seat with child when possible

---

## Floor Time

### Playing at Their Level

**The challenge:**
- Hours on floor
- Various positions
- Hard surfaces
- Quick transitions

### Sustainable Positions

**Sitting options:**
- Cross-legged with support
- Side-sitting (alternate sides)
- Kneeling on cushion
- Low stool or cushion

**Avoiding:**
- W-sitting
- Prolonged kneeling without pad
- Same position for extended time

### Getting Up and Down

**Technique:**
- Use furniture for support
- One knee up, push with hands
- Engage core
- Not endless floor squatting

---

## Diaper Changes

### The Setup

**Changing table:**
- Proper height (waist level)
- Everything within reach
- Don't hunch over

**Floor changes:**
- Kneel on pad
- Bring supplies to you
- Face your work
- Change positions between kids if multiples

---

## Bath Time

### Kneeling at Tub

**Protection:**
- Thick kneeling pad

## Self-Care Challenges

### Why It's Hard

- Child needs are immediate
- Guilt about personal time
- Exhaustion removes motivation

### Making It Possible

**Micro self-care:**

**Finding time:**
- Partner's return
- During naps
- Early morning
- Evening routine

**Reducing guilt:**
- Healthy parent = better parenting
- Modeling self-care
- Sustainability matters
- Not selfish, necessary

## Sleep Deprivation and Posture

### The Impact

**Tired affects everything:**

- Injury risk increases

### Coping

**Sleep when possible:**
- Prioritize rest
- Ask for help with night duties
- Rest even if not sleeping

**Posture despite fatigue:**
- Basic awareness
- Not perfect, just not damaging
- Gentle with yourself
- This phase passes

---

## Partner and Support

### Sharing the Load

**Physical labor:**
- Divide heavy tasks
- Trade lifting duties
- Cover for self-care time
- Communicate about body strain

### Asking for Help

**It's okay to:**
- Ask for breaks
- Need physical help
- Prioritize your body sometimes
- Not do everything

---

## Age-Stage Adaptations

### Infancy

- Sleep deprivation peak
- Feeding positions matter

### Toddlerhood

- Heavier lifting
- Constant movement

### Preschool and Beyond
