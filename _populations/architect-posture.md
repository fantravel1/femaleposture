# Architect Posture

Architecture is a profession of diverse physical demands—hours at computer screens running CAD software, time at drafting tables for hand drawings, site visits involving walking and standing on uneven terrain, and client presentations requiring confident presence. Female architects face unique challenges navigating these varied work environments while maintaining physical health.

## CAD and Computer Work

### Extended Screen Time
Architectural CAD work often involves 8+ hours at screens.

### Detail Focus
Zooming into fine details encourages forward head posture.

### Mouse Precision
Precise mouse work creates hand and wrist strain.

### Dual Monitor Navigation
Large projects often require dual or multiple monitors.

## Drafting Table Considerations

### Table Height
Drafting tables should be height-adjustable for your body.

### Angle Options
Tilted surfaces reduce forward bending.

### Stool Selection
Drafting stools need proper height and support.

### Arm Position
Arms should rest comfortably while drawing.

## Studio Environment

### Shared Spaces
Open studios may have limited ergonomic accommodation.

### Desk Customization
Advocate for equipment that fits your needs.

### Model Building
Physical model work involves varied hand positions.

### Presentation Preparation
Pin-ups and presentations involve standing and reaching.

## Site Visit Demands

### Construction Site Navigation
Uneven surfaces, stairs, and climbing require stability.

### Protective Gear
Hard hats and safety equipment affect posture.

### Extended Standing
Site observation involves prolonged standing.

### Documentation
Taking notes and photos while navigating sites.

## Design Review Posture

### Standing Presentations
Presenting work to clients and teams.

### Conference Room Seating
Review meetings may last hours.

### Charrette Sessions
Intensive design sessions with varied activities.

### Collaborative Drawing
Working together at tables or walls.

## Common Postural Issues

### Forward Head
Screen and drawing focus pulls head forward.

### Rounded Shoulders
Reaching forward for extended periods.

### Lower Back Strain
Prolonged sitting without adequate support.

### Wrist Problems
Mouse and stylus work strain wrists.

## Workstation Optimization

### Monitor Position
Screen at eye level, arm's length distance.

### Keyboard and Mouse
At elbow height with wrist support.

### Chair Quality
High-quality ergonomic chair for long hours.

### Lighting
Adequate lighting reduces eye strain and hunching.

## Movement Integration

### Design Breaks
Build movement into the design process.

### Printing Opportunities
Walking to plotters and printers.

### Meeting Walks
Walking meetings when possible.

### Stair Use
Use stairs instead of elevators.

## Studio Culture

### Long Hours Culture
Architecture often involves late nights—prioritize self-care.

### Modeling Culture
Change how you approach physical desk challenges.

### Mentoring Others
Share ergonomic knowledge with junior staff.

### Workplace Advocacy
Advocate for better equipment and policies.

## Physical Wellness Practices

### Regular Stretching
Desk stretches throughout the day.

### Core Strengthening
Strong core supports extended sitting.

### Hand and Wrist Care
Exercises and stretches for drawing/mouse work.

### Eye Care
Regular eye breaks from detailed screen work.

Architecture combines creative vision with technical precision, but it shouldn't cost your physical health. Attention to ergonomics across your varied work environments supports a sustainable career in this demanding profession.
