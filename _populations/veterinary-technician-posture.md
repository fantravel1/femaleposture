# Veterinary Technician Posture

> **Caring for Animals Is Physical Work:** Lifting, restraining, bending, and reacting to unpredictable patients demands body awareness and protection.

---

## The Vet Tech Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Animal lifting** - Varied sizes, often awkward
- **Restraint** - Holding moving patients
- **Bending and reaching** - Exam tables, cages, floors
- **Unpredictable movements** - Animals don't cooperate
- **Extended standing** - Most of the day
- **Physical strength** - Required regularly

### Common Problems

- Lower back injuries (most common)
- Shoulder strain from lifting
- Bites and scratches (acute injury)
- Wrist strain from restraint
- Neck tension
- Overall fatigue

---

## Lifting Animals

### The Challenge

**Unlike lifting boxes:**
- Animals move
- Can't always get proper grip
- Varied sizes and shapes
- May struggle or jump

### Best Practices

**Small animals:**
- Scoop close to body
- Support fully
- Lift with legs
- Keep close and secure

**Medium animals:**
- Two-person lift when possible
- Proper grip points
- Communication with partner
- Control before lifting

**Large animals:**
- Always team effort
- Mechanical aids when available
- Don't be a hero
- Know the animal's behavior

### From Cages

**Low cages especially:**
- Squat down (don't bend at waist)
- Bring animal close before lifting
- Lift with legs
- Consider cage positioning

---

## Restraint Positions

### The Physical Demands

**Holding patients:**
- Sustained muscle engagement
- Awkward positions sometimes
- Strength required
- Can be prolonged

### Protecting Yourself

**During restraint:**
- Core engaged
- Good base of support
- Let table support animal weight
- Ask for help when needed

**For difficult patients:**
- More hands
- Sedation when appropriate
- Don't injure yourself for a procedure
- Safety first

---

## Working at Exam Tables

### Height Considerations

**Table height:**
- Adjustable height ideal
- Reduces bending or reaching
- Change for different activities
- Change for different animals

### Positioning

**During procedures:**
- Stand square to table
- Don't twist
- Get help for positioning
- Move around table as needed

---

## Cage and Kennel Work

### Low and High Cages

**Low cages:**
- Squat or kneel
- Don't bend repeatedly at waist
- Knee pads helpful
- Consider cage reorganization

**High cages:**
- Step stool for reaching
- Don't overstretch
- Bring animal to comfortable level

### Cleaning

**Cage cleaning demands:**
- Reaching into cages
- Lifting bedding/supplies
- Repetitive motions
- Technique matters even for routine tasks

---

## Radiology and Imaging

### Positioning Patients

**Specific demands:**
- Precise positioning needed
- May require sustained holding
- Awkward angles
- Lead protection adds weight

### Best Practices

**During imaging:**
- Use positioning aids
- Sedation when appropriate
- Don't absorb undue strain
- Rotate duties

---

## Dental and Anesthesia

### Working Over Patient

**Sustained positions:**
- Looking down at patient
- Neck strain risk
- Prolonged static position

### Protection

**During procedures:**
- Stool height appropriate
- Patient at good level
- Periodic position changes
- Neck stretches between patients

---

## Surgery Assistance

### Standing for Procedures

**Extended surgical assistance:**
- On feet for hours
- Focused on procedure
- Minimal movement
- Position sustained

### Managing

**During long surgeries:**
- Best possible footwear
- Anti-fatigue mat
- Subtle weight shifts
- Stretch between surgeries

---

## Emergency and Critical Care

### High-Intensity Moments

**Emergency situations:**
- Adrenaline takes over
- Body mechanics forgotten
- Acute injury risk increases
- Unpredictable patient behavior

### Afterward

**Post-emergency:**
- Check your body
- Stretch and move
- Note any strain
- Address injuries immediately

---

## End of Day

### Recovery

**After shift:**
- Stretch routine
- Note any pain
- Address issues early
- Don't ignore signals

### Building Resilience

**Off-work:**
- Regular exercise
- Core and back strengthening
- Flexibility work
- Adequate rest

---

## Team Communication

### Asking for Help

**Essential:**
- Extra hands when needed
- Two-person lifts
- Difficult patient assistance
- It's not weakness

### Training Others

**As experienced tech:**
- Model good technique
- Teach proper handling
- Create safe culture
- Protect the team

---

## Quick Stretches

### Between Patients

**Brief resets:**
- Shoulder rolls
- Neck stretches
- Back extension
- Wrist circles

### When Possible

**Longer breaks:**
- Full body stretch
- Movement variety
- Walk around
- Rest from standing
