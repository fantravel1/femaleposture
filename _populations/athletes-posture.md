# Posture for Athletes: Performance and Injury Prevention

> **Performance Foundation:** Good posture isn't just about appearance—for athletes, it affects power, efficiency, and injury risk. Sport-specific posture matters.

---

## Why Posture Matters for Athletes

### Performance Effects

- Optimal force production
- Efficient movement patterns
- Better breathing capacity
- Proper joint mechanics
- Reduced energy waste

### Injury Prevention

- Reduced compensation patterns
- Better load distribution
- Proper joint alignment
- Decreased overuse injury risk
- More resilient structures

---

## Common Athletic Posture Issues

### Sport-Induced Imbalances

**Swimmers:**
- Rounded shoulders from stroke mechanics
- Upper trap dominance
- Thoracic kyphosis

**Runners:**
- Forward head from fatigue
- Hip flexor tightness
- Asymmetries from road camber

**Cyclists:**
- Rounded thoracic spine
- Tight hip flexors
- Forward head position

**Volleyball/Tennis:**
- Shoulder imbalances
- Asymmetric trunk rotation
- One-sided dominance

**Weightlifters:**
- Tight lats affecting overhead
- Hip flexor tightness
- Possible asymmetries

---

## Sport-Specific Considerations

### Swimming

**Common issues:**
- Internal rotation dominance
- Rounded shoulders
- Lat tightness

**Address with:**
- External rotation exercises
- Face pulls
- Thoracic extension work
- Chest stretching

### Running

**Common issues:**
- Hip flexor tightness
- Weak glutes
- Forward lean that becomes slump

**Address with:**
- Hip flexor stretching
- Glute strengthening
- Core work
- Running form drills

### Cycling

**Common issues:**
- Thoracic stiffness
- Hip flexor shortening
- Neck extension stress

**Address with:**
- Thoracic mobility
- Hip flexor stretching
- Upper back strengthening
- Neck stretches

### Team Sports

**Common issues:**
- Sport-specific imbalances
- Impact-related issues
- Asymmetric demands

**Address with:**
- Balanced training
- Mobility work
- Sport-specific prehab
- Core stability

### Lifting/CrossFit

**Common issues:**
- Tight lats affecting overhead
- Hip mobility limitations
- Postural stress from heavy loads

**Address with:**
- Lat stretching
- Hip mobility work
- Thoracic extension
- Recovery focus

---

## Assessment for Athletes

### What to Look For

**Standing:**
- Shoulder symmetry
- Pelvic position
- Spinal alignment
- Side-to-side differences

**Dynamic:**
- Movement patterns
- Sport-specific positions
- Fatigue-related changes

### Sport-Specific Checks

- Overhead mobility (for overhead sports)
- Hip mobility (for running, jumping)
- Shoulder balance (for throwing)
- Trunk rotation (for rotational sports)

---

## Key Exercises for Athletes

### Core Stability

**Essential for all athletes:**
- Dead bug variations
- Pallof press
- Side planks
- Carries

### Hip Mobility and Strength

**Critical for lower body sports:**
- Hip flexor stretches
- 90/90 stretches
- Glute bridges
- Single-leg work

### Upper Back and Shoulder

**Especially for upper body sports:**
- Face pulls
- Rows
- External rotation work
- Thoracic mobility

### Sport-Specific Prehab

Work with coach or trainer to identify and address your sport's demands.

## Posture During Training

### Form Matters

- Maintain posture during fatigue
- Quality over quantity
- Stop when form breaks
- Train posture awareness

### Common Mistakes

- Sacrificing form for performance
- Ignoring compensations
- Training through pain
- Neglecting mobility work

---

## Recovery and Posture

### Post-Training

- Stretching routine
- Foam rolling
- Address tight areas
- Reset posture

### Rest Days

- Active recovery
- Mobility focus
- Counteract sport postures
- Balance work

### Sleep

- Good sleep position
- Adequate recovery time
- Supportive mattress
- [See sleep position guide](/tools/sleep-position-guide/)

---

## Balancing Training

### Address Imbalances

**One-sided sports:**
- Include bilateral work
- Train opposite patterns
- Address asymmetries

**Flexion-dominant sports:**
- Include extension work
- Open chest and hips
- Strengthen posterior chain

**Internal rotation sports:**
- External rotation exercises
- Balance shoulder mechanics
- Stretch internal rotators

---

## Breathing and Posture

### Athletic Breathing

- Posture affects breathing capacity
- Proper diaphragmatic breathing
- Sport-specific breathing patterns
- Recovery breathing

### Connection to Performance

- Better posture = better breathing
- More oxygen available
- Improved endurance
- Better recovery

---

## Working with Professionals

### Who Can Help

- Sports physical therapist
- Strength and conditioning coach
- Sports medicine doctor
- Qualified personal trainer

### When to Seek Help

- Recurring injuries
- Performance plateaus
- Significant asymmetries
- Pain with training

---

## Sample Programs

### General Athletic Maintenance (15-20 min)
