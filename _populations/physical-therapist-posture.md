# Physical Therapist and PT Assistant Posture

> **The Irony of Our Profession:** We teach patients about body mechanics while compromising our own. Time to practice what we preach.

---

## The PT Work Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Patient handling** - Transfers, guarding, manual therapy
- **Awkward positions** - Bending, kneeling, reaching
- **Variable heights** - Treatment tables, mats, patient beds
- **Repetitive motions** - Manual techniques all day
- **Standing and moving** - Rarely sitting during treatment
- **Documentation** - Computer work between patients

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain (most common)
- Shoulder strain from manual work
- Neck tension
- Wrist/hand fatigue
- Knee issues from kneeling

---

## Patient Handling

### The Challenge

**We know better, but:**
- Rushing between patients
- Patient needs come first
- Awkward positioning required
- Heavy or dependent patients

### Protecting Yourself

**Transfers:**
- Use proper body mechanics (really)
- Get help when needed
- Use equipment available
- Wide base, bent knees

**Guarding/Support:**
- Position yourself well before starting
- Stay close to patient
- Use your legs
- Know your limits

**Manual therapy:**
- Table height appropriate
- Body behind hands
- Core engaged
- Don't rely on arm strength alone

---

## Treatment Positions

### Working at Different Heights

**At mat level:**
- Kneel properly (one or both knees)
- Use cushioning
- Change positions frequently
- Alternate legs when half-kneeling

**At table level:**
- Adjust table height for each patient
- Not too low (bending) or high (reaching)
- Stand close

**Bedside (hospital):**
- Adjust bed height
- Side rails down for access
- Don't reach across

### Prolonged Positions

**Long treatment sessions:**
- Build in position changes
- Move around patient
- Stretch between patients

---

## Manual Therapy Ergonomics

### Hand and Wrist Care

**Repetitive stress:**
- Vary techniques
- Use body weight, not just hands
- Proper grip
- Stretch between sessions

### Shoulder Protection

**Sustained work:**
- Keep elbows close
- Don't reach
- Use whole body
- Core-driven movement

### Body Positioning

**During techniques:**
- Face your work
- Power from legs and core
- Not just arms
- Breathe

---

## Documentation Posture

### Between Patients

**The computer trap:**
- Rushed typing
- Poor workstation setup
- Hunching to chart quickly

### Better Approach

**Workstation setup:**
- Proper desk ergonomics
- Even if only 10 minutes at a time
- Eye level screen
- Supportive seating

**Timing:**
- Document throughout day
- Not marathon sessions
- Alternate sitting/standing

---

## Clinic vs. Home Health

### Clinic Setting

**Advantages:**
- Consistent equipment
- Adjustable tables
- Controlled environment

**Challenges:**
- Back-to-back patients
- Limited break time
- Productivity pressure

### Home Health

**Challenges:**
- Variable environments
- Low beds, soft furniture
- No equipment
- Carrying supplies

**Strategies:**
- Portable stool for positioning
- Kneel on floor cushion
- Modify exercises to environment
- Protect yourself first

---

## Self-Care for PTs

### During the Day

**Between patients:**
- Quick stretches
- Posture reset
- Move differently
- Hydrate

**Between clinics/homes:**
- Decompress in car (seated stretches)
- Reset before next patient

### End of Day

**Recovery:**
- Stretch routine
- Address any pain early
- Don't ignore warning signs
- Practice what you teach

---

## The "Cobbler's Children" Problem

### Why We Neglect Ourselves

- Focus on patients
- Time pressure
- Thinking we're immune
- Knowing better doesn't mean doing better

### Breaking the Pattern

**Commit to:**
- Own posture practice
- Regular exercise
- Seeking treatment when needed (yes, see another PT)
- Not being a hypocrite

---

## Building Career Longevity

### Prevention Focus

**Your body is your tool:**
- Protect it
- Maintain it
- Longevity in career requires self-care

### When to Get Help

- Persistent pain
- Technique changes to avoid pain
- Any concerning symptoms
- Early intervention

---

## Equipment and Tools

### Helpful Items

- Proper footwear
- Knee pads for floor work
- Gait belt (use it!)
- Transfer equipment available
- Adjustable tables

### Workspace Requests

**Advocate for:**
- Height-adjustable tables
- Proper equipment
- Reasonable schedules
- Adequate space
