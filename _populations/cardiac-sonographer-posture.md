# Cardiac Sonographer Posture

Cardiac sonographers perform echocardiograms to visualize heart function. Female cardiac sonographers work in challenging ergonomic conditions, applying pressure with transducers while maintaining awkward positions for extended imaging studies. The physical demands are significant and injury rates are high in this profession.

## Imaging Demands

### Transducer Pressure
Sustained pressure application.

### Patient Positioning
Working around patient position.

### Extended Studies
Long imaging procedures.

### Repetitive Scanning
Multiple patients daily.

## Physical Challenges

### Arm Position
Extended reaching across patients.

### Wrist Angle
Transducer manipulation.

### Shoulder Strain
Sustained arm positions.

### Neck Tension
Screen and patient viewing.

## Common Injuries

### Shoulder Problems
Rotator cuff strain.

### Wrist Issues
Carpal tunnel risk.

### Neck Pain
Twisted viewing positions.

### Back Strain
Awkward positioning.

## Equipment Ergonomics

### Machine Placement
Optimal equipment position.
