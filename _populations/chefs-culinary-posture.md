# Chef and Culinary Worker Posture

> **The Kitchen Demands:** Long shifts on your feet, heavy lifting, repetitive motions, and workstations at the wrong height—kitchens present unique postural challenges. Here's how to protect your body while cooking.

---

## Kitchen Posture Challenges

### What Makes It Hard

- **10-14 hour shifts** on feet
- **Constant standing** on hard floors
- **Heavy lifting** - pots, trays, supplies
- **Repetitive motions** - chopping, stirring, plating
- **Awkward heights** - counters often too low
- **Time pressure** - no time for breaks
- **Heat** - fatigue adds up
- **Looking down** - constant neck flexion

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain (most common)
- Foot and leg fatigue
- Neck pain from looking down
- Shoulder strain from stirring, lifting
- Wrist/hand issues from cutting

---

## Standing Fundamentals

### All-Day Standing

**Basics:**
- Weight distributed evenly
- Soft knees (not locked)
- Core gently engaged
- Shoulders back
- Head balanced

**Reality check:**
- Perfect posture all shift is impossible
- Variety is more important than perfection
- Move and shift constantly

### Floor Surface Matters

**Anti-fatigue mats:**
- Use wherever you station
- Make a huge difference
- Should be at every prep area
- Replace when worn

**Footwear:**
- Non-slip (essential)
- Supportive arch
- Cushioned
- Proper fit
- Replace regularly

---

## Workstation Setup

### Counter Height Problems

**Most counters are:**
- 36 inches standard
- Too low for taller people
- Force forward bending
- Not adjustable

**Solutions:**
- Cutting boards on risers
- Portable elevated surfaces
- Request adjustable stations
- Advocate for ergonomic design

### Optimal Working Height

**For most tasks:**
- Elbows at 90 degrees
- Work surface just below elbow height
- No excessive bending or reaching

### Reaching

- Keep frequently used items close
- Don't overreach
- Step closer instead of stretching
- Organize workspace for efficiency

---

## Common Kitchen Tasks

### Chopping and Prep

**Posture:**
- Work at proper height
- Board angled toward you if possible
- Stand close to counter
- Core engaged

**Technique:**
- Let knife weight do work
- Relax grip when possible
- Vary cutting angles
- Switch hands occasionally if able

**Breaks:**
- Step back and stretch
- Roll wrists
- Shoulder rolls
- Every 20-30 minutes

### Stirring and Mixing

**Challenges:**
- Sustained arm position
- Torque on wrist/shoulder
- Often at low height (pots)

**Solutions:**
- Stand directly facing pot
- Keep arm close to body
- Switch hands
- Use largest appropriate tools
- Step stool to raise yourself if pot is low

### Lifting Heavy Pots

**Technique:**
- Squat, don't bend
- Get close before lifting
- Lift with legs
- Keep load close
- Don't twist while carrying

**When it's too heavy:**
- Ask for help
- Use two people
- Transfer contents in portions
- Use rolling carts

### Plating

**Challenges:**
- Leaning over plates
- Fine motor work
- Speed pressure

**Solutions:**
- Plates at good height
- Stand close
- Micro-breaks between covers
- Roll shoulders between tickets

---

## During Service

### The Rush

**Reality:**
- No time for stretching
- Constant motion
- Adrenaline masking fatigue

**What you can do:**
- Quick position shifts between orders
- Shoulder shrug and release
- Weight shift side to side
- Breathe

### Between Rushes

- Step away briefly
- Quick stretches
- Hydrate
- Sit if possible

## Lifting and Carrying

### Daily Lifting

**Heavy items:**
- Stockpots
- Sheet trays
- Supply deliveries
- Trash/grease

**Technique:**
- Always squat to lift
- Keep close to body
- Pivot feet, don't twist
- Ask for help when needed

### Reaching Overhead

- Use step stool
- Don't strain to reach
- Keep frequently used items lower
- Request accessible storage

### Loading/Unloading

- Take multiple trips
- Use carts
- Stage items at waist height
- Don't rush

---

## Stretches for Kitchen Staff

- Both directions
- 5 each way

**Shoulder shrugs:**
