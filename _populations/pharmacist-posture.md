# Pharmacist and Pharmacy Technician Posture

> **Behind the Counter All Day:** Pharmacy work combines standing, computer use, counting, and customer interaction—all in a confined space. Your body needs attention.

---

## The Pharmacy Work Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Extended standing** - 8-12 hour shifts on feet
- **Confined workspace** - Limited movement area
- **Repetitive tasks** - Counting, typing, scanning
- **Computer work** - Prescription processing
- **Customer interaction** - Leaning over counter
- **Reaching** - High shelves, low drawers

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain from standing
- Neck strain from computer work
- Shoulder tension from counting
- Foot and leg fatigue
- Wrist issues from typing/counting

---

## Standing for Hours

### The Challenge

**All-day standing causes:**
- Lower back fatigue
- Leg tiredness
- Foot pain
- Poor posture as day progresses

### Solutions

**Anti-fatigue mat:**
- Essential at workstation
- Proper thickness
- Replace when worn

**Weight shifting:**
- Alternate feet on small stool
- Shift weight regularly
- Don't lock knees

**Footwear:**
- Supportive shoes
- Cushioned insoles
- Replace when worn
- Consider compression socks

**Micro-breaks:**
- Brief walks when possible
- Seated tasks if available
- Move within space

---

## Counting and Filling

### Repetitive Motion

**Pill counting:**
- Shoulder tension
- Wrist strain
- Forward lean

### Better Technique

**Workstation height:**
- Counter at comfortable level
- Not reaching up or hunching down
- Elbow height ideal

**Body position:**
- Stand square to work
- Don't twist to count
- Keep supplies close

**Hand care:**
- Vary which hand counts
- Stretch fingers periodically
- Light grip on tools

---

## Computer Work at Pharmacy

### The Setup Challenge

**Often problematic:**
- Screen too low or high
- Keyboard placement awkward
- Space constraints
- Shared workstations

### Optimize What You Can

**Screen position:**
- Eye level when standing
- Arm's length distance
- Reduce glare

**Keyboard:**
- Comfortable height
- Wrists neutral
- Not reaching

**If sitting available:**
- Proper chair setup
- Take seated breaks
- Alternate positions

---

## Customer Interaction

### Counter Conversations

**Leaning forward issues:**
- Hunching over counter
- Neck strain looking down
- Sustained poor position

### Better Approach

**Position:**
- Stand tall
- Step closer rather than lean
- Face customer directly

**Counter height:**
- Can't change it, but can adjust you
- Foot stool for shorter pharmacists
- Don't chronically hunch

---

## Reaching and Lifting

### Shelf Access

**High shelves:**
- Use step stool
- Don't overreach
- Bring items to you

**Low shelves:**
- Squat or kneel
- Don't bend at waist repeatedly
- Consider reorganizing frequently-used items

### Lifting Boxes

- Keep loads close
- Lift with legs
- Get help for heavy items
- Push/pull when possible

---

## Confined Space Movement

### Making the Most of Limited Space

**Within the pharmacy:**
- Walk to different stations
- Vary tasks when possible
- Use any opportunity to move

**Creative movement:**
- Calf raises while counting
- Shoulder rolls between customers
- Subtle stretches throughout

---

## Shift Survival

### Long Shifts

**Pacing yourself:**
- Don't stand rigid
- Keep moving gently
- Hydrate
- Eat regular meals

### Break Time

**Use breaks wisely:**
- Sit down
- Stretch
- Walk outside if possible
- Get off your feet

---

## Quick Stretches

### Behind the Counter

**Neck:**
- Chin tucks
- Gentle side tilts
- 10 seconds each

**Shoulders:**
- Rolls backward
- Squeeze shoulder blades
- Drop tension

**Back:**

---

## Building Resilience

### Off-Work Priorities

**Recovery:**
