# Construction and Trades Worker Posture

> **Physical Work Demands Respect:** Construction and trades are hard on the body. Smart body mechanics protect you for a long career.

---

## The Construction Challenge

### Physical Demands

- **Heavy lifting** - Materials, tools, equipment
- **Awkward positions** - Cramped spaces, overhead work
- **Repetitive motions** - Hammering, drilling, bending
- **All-day physical work** - No desk breaks
- **Variable conditions** - Weather, surfaces, environments
- **Tool use** - Vibration, weight, grip

### Common Problems

- Lower back injuries (most common)
- Shoulder strain
- Knee problems
- Hand and wrist issues
- Neck pain (looking up)
- Whole-body fatigue

---

## Lifting and Carrying

### The Foundation

**Every lift matters:**
- Injuries often sudden
- Cumulative damage adds up
- Technique is protection
- Non-negotiable safety

### Proper Lifting

**The basics (yes, again):**
- Get close to load
- Feet shoulder-width apart
- Squat down, bend knees
- Back straight (not vertical, just not rounded)
- Grip firmly
- Lift with legs
- Keep load close
- No twisting while lifting

**Reality check:**
- You know this
- Rushing causes skips
- Fatigue causes skips
- Stay mindful anyway

### Team Lifting

**When to get help:**
- Anything awkward
- Heavy loads
- Limited space
- Communicate during lift
- Coordinate movement

### Carrying

- Keep load close
- Balanced if possible
- Multiple trips > one heavy trip
- Use equipment when available
- Don't be a hero

---

## Working Overhead

### The Problem

**Looking and reaching up:**
- Neck strain
- Shoulder fatigue
- Back extension
- Arms tire

### Protection Strategies

**Reduce overhead time:**
- Use scaffolding/platform (work at level)
- Ladders for appropriate height
- Extension tools when possible
- Break up overhead work

**When working overhead:**
- Position directly under work
- Arms bent, not fully extended
- Frequent breaks
- Neck stretches

---

## Working Below

### Kneeling

**Knee protection:**
- Always use knee pads
- Quality matters
- Replace when worn
- Alternate kneeling positions

**Getting up/down:**
- Use supports
- Don't just drop to knees
- Push from legs

### Ground-Level Work

**Squatting:**
- Deep squats better than bending
- Take breaks from squat
- Kneel instead when sustained
- Vary positions

**Bending:**
- Hip hinge, not back rounding
- Squat when possible
- Short duration only
- Many bends = injury risk

---

## Tool Use

### Heavy Tools

**Handling:**
- Two hands when needed
- Proper grip
- Let tool do work
- Support weight

### Vibrating Tools

**Vibration exposure:**
- Limit duration
- Use anti-vibration gloves
- Alternate tasks
- Proper grip (not too tight)
- Breaks from vibration

### Repetitive Tool Use

**Hammering, drilling, etc.:**
- Vary tasks when possible
- Switch hands if applicable
- Proper tool size for hand
- Don't death-grip
- Rest between intense use

---

## Working in Tight Spaces

### Cramped Positions

**When space is limited:**
- Position yourself before starting
- Minimize time in awkward positions
- Use appropriate tools
- Take breaks to stretch

### Contorting

**Twisted positions:**
- Face your work when possible
- Minimize duration
- Counter-stretch after
- Some positions unavoidable—limit time

---

## Site Movement

### Walking and Climbing

**Uneven terrain:**
- Watch footing
- Appropriate footwear
- Carry loads carefully
- Don't rush

**Ladders:**
- Three points of contact
- Face ladder
- Tools in belt or haul up separately
- Proper setup

### Stairs and Scaffolding

- Hold rails
- Clear path
- Appropriate footwear
- Load carrying considerations

---

## Equipment Use

### Wheelbarrows and Carts

- Don't overload
- Push with body
- Balanced loads
- Proper path

### Power Equipment

- Proper positioning
- Secure stance
- Follow guidelines
- Let equipment work

---

## Women-Specific Considerations

### Size and Equipment

**May need:**
- Smaller tool grips
- Properly fitting PPE
- Appropriate ladder/equipment size
- Don't use ill-fitting equipment

### Technique Over Strength

**Work smarter:**
- Leverage and technique matter most
- Proper body mechanics
- Use available equipment
- Team lift more readily

### Breaking In

**New to the trades:**
- Build up gradually
- Don't prove yourself through injury
- It's okay to protect your body
- Experience teaches efficiency

---

## End of Day

### Before Going Home

**Quick recovery:**
- Brief stretches
- Note any pain
- Hydrate
- Don't skip cool-down

### At Home

**Recovery priorities:**
- Adequate rest
- Stretch routine
- Address soreness
- Sleep for repair

### Off-Day Activity

**Between work days:**
- Light movement (not more labor)
- Stretching
- Strengthening
- Active recovery

---

## Building Career Longevity

### Your Body Is Your Tool

**Career reality:**
- Bodies break down over time
- Prevention is investment
- Injuries have consequences
- Protect your future

### When to Speak Up

**Safety matters:**
- Unreasonable demands
- Inadequate equipment
- Unsafe conditions
- Your body, your responsibility

### Knowing Limits

- Experience teaches limits
- Ego causes injuries
- Team work helps all
- Long career > short heroics

---

## Warning Signs

### Don't Ignore

- Recurring pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Weakness
- Pain that worsens

### Early Intervention

- Address issues quickly
- See providers
- Modify work if needed
- Prevent serious injury
