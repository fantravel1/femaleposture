# Yoga and Pilates Instructor Posture

> **Teaching Movement, Protecting Yourself:** Instructors demonstrate poses repeatedly, assist students in positions, and model alignment for hours. Your own body needs attention too.

---

## The Instructor Paradox

### The Challenge

You teach posture and alignment... but:
- Demonstrate constantly without warm-up
- Repeat poses endlessly
- Assist from awkward angles
- Teach multiple classes daily
- Your body is your livelihood

### Common Problems

- Overuse injuries
- Shoulder issues (assisting, demonstrating)
- Wrist problems (weight-bearing repeatedly)
- Lower back strain
- Hip issues from repetitive movements
- Burnout of specific patterns

---

## Demonstrating Safely

### The Demonstration Trap

**What happens:**
- Cold demonstrations
- Same poses repeatedly
- More extreme than needed
- Teaching through your body

### Better Approach

**Warm up:**
- Gentle movement before class
- Don't demonstrate cold
- Start simple

**Partial demonstrations:**
- Show key points only
- Don't do full practice during teaching
- Verbal cues instead of constant showing
- Save your body

**Rotation:**
- Don't always show the same side
- Balance left and right demonstrations
- Vary what you demonstrate

---

## Assisting Students

### Manual Adjustments

**Challenges:**
- Bending to students
- Awkward angles
- Applying force
- Sustained positions

**Better mechanics:**

**Bending:**
- Squat or kneel rather than bend at waist
- Get close before adjusting
- Face your work

**Contact:**
- Use body weight, not muscle force
- Efficient use of leverage
- Minimal effort maximum effect

**Duration:**
- Brief, clear adjustments
- Don't hold indefinitely
- Move to next student

### Props and Tools

**Reduce body strain:**
- Blocks to elevate students
- Straps for assists
- Bolsters for support
- Let props do work

---

## Class Load Management

### Multiple Classes

**Teaching 4+ classes/day:**
- Cumulative strain
- Repetitive patterns
- Exhaustion

**Strategies:**
- Limit full demonstrations
- Vary what you show each class
- Don't do your own practice during class
- Verbal cueing skills

### Class Types

**Vary your teaching:**
- Not all high-demand classes
- Mix gentle and challenging
- Variety prevents overuse

---

## Your Own Practice

### Separate from Teaching

**Critical distinction:**
- Teaching is not your practice
- Need your own time
- Not demonstrating—practicing
- Restorative included

### What You Need

- Practice at your level, not demonstration level
- Recovery practices
- Strength work outside your teaching genre
- Cross-training

### Addressing Imbalances

**From teaching patterns:**
- Identify your go-to demonstrations
- Work opposite patterns
- Balance your body

---

## Specific Considerations

### Wrists

**Yoga/Pilates is weight-bearing:**
- Repeated down dogs, planks, arm balances
- Wrist strain common

**Protection:**
- Strength training for wrists
- Modified positions when needed
- Watch for pain
- Vary arm positions

### Shoulders

**Constant reaching, demonstrating:**
- Rotator cuff strain
- Impingement risk

**Protection:**
- Shoulder strengthening
- Proper mechanics in demos
- Rest when needed

### Hips

**Repetitive opening, flexion:**
- Overuse possible
- Hypermobility concerns

**Protection:**
- Don't always go to end range
- Stability work
- Listen to your body

### Lower Back

**From assisting, demonstrating:**
- Bending repeatedly
- Loading in flexion

**Protection:**
- Proper bending mechanics
- Core strength
- Don't overdo backbends

---

## Teaching Posture

### Standing and Circulating

**During class:**
- Move around
- Don't stand fixed
- Good standing posture
- Model what you teach

### Cueing Position

- Face class appropriately
- Project without straining
- Comfortable stance

---

## Building Sustainability

### Cross-Training

**Essential for instructors:**
- Strength training
- Cardiovascular work
- Activities unlike your teaching
- Recovery practices

### Restorative Priority

**Include:**
- Restorative yoga/movement
- Rest days
- Sleep
- Active recovery

### Longevity Focus

- Career spanning decades
- Sustainable load
- Evolving as body changes
- Not burning out

---

## Warning Signs

### When to Back Off

- Persistent pain
- Teaching through injury
- Dreading movement
- Body not recovering

### Professional Help

- Physical therapy when needed
- Massage and bodywork
- Medical attention for injuries
- Don't teach through problems

---

## Evolution of Teaching

### As You Age

- Less demonstrating, more cueing
- More experienced, fewer demos needed
- Teaching from wisdom, not just body
- Sustainable practice

### Specialization

- May focus on specific populations
- Therapeutic work
- Less physically demanding areas
- Use accumulated knowledge
