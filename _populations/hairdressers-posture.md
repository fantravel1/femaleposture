# Hairdressers & Beauticians Posture Guide

Hairdressers and beauticians face unique postural challenges. You're on your feet all day, arms raised for extended periods, leaning over clients, and performing repetitive hand movements—all while looking fabulous and keeping clients happy.

This guide addresses the specific ergonomic issues you face and provides practical solutions that work in a busy salon environment.

## Why Salon Work Destroys Posture

### Extended Arms-Raised Position

Cutting, blow-drying, and styling require holding your arms at or above shoulder level for extended periods. This creates:
- Upper trapezius overload
- Shoulder impingement risk
- Neck strain from tension

### Constant Standing

8+ hours on your feet causes:
- Lower back fatigue
- Leg and foot pain
- Pelvic floor strain
- Varicose vein development

### Leaning and Reaching

Bending over shampoo bowls and reaching around clients leads to:
- Rounded upper back
- Lower back strain
- Unilateral overuse (always reaching the same direction)

### Repetitive Hand Movements

Cutting, texturizing, and styling involve:
- Wrist strain
- Thumb overuse
- Potential carpal tunnel issues
- Forearm tension

### Additional Beauty Service Challenges

Estheticians and nail technicians face:
- Prolonged neck flexion (looking down at faces or nails)
- Forward-reaching posture for waxing, facials
- Fine motor work causing hand and wrist strain

## Common Postural Problems

### "Scissor Shoulder"

From holding cutting arm raised:
- One shoulder higher than the other
- Overdeveloped upper trap on dominant side
- Neck tilting toward raised shoulder

### "Shampoo Bowl Hunch"

From leaning over clients:
- Rounded upper back
- Forward head posture
- Lower back strain

### "Standing Sway"

From compensating during long standing hours:
- Excessive lumbar curve (anterior tilt)
- Weight shifting to one leg
- Hip and lower back pain

### Wrist and Hand Issues

- Carpal tunnel symptoms
- Trigger finger
- Thumb base arthritis
- Forearm tendinitis

## Station Setup for Better Posture

### Cutting/Styling Station

**Chair Height:**
- Client chair should adjust so you work at elbow height
- Your elbows should be bent at about 90 degrees while cutting
- Invest in a quality hydraulic chair

**Your Positioning:**
- Stand close to the client—don't reach
- Move around the chair rather than leaning
- Use a footrest if you need to be higher temporarily

**Mirror and Product Placement:**
- Products within arm's reach without stretching
- Mirror at correct height for standing
- Lighting that doesn't require you to strain to see

### Shampoo Bowl Setup

**Bowl Height:**
- Should allow you to stand upright while shampooing
- Your arms should not be raised above shoulder level
- If too low, use a step stool to elevate yourself

**Positioning:**
- Stand facing the bowl when possible
- Avoid repeated twisting
- Use a knee pad or anti-fatigue mat in this area

### Pedicure/Nail Station

**Chair Selection:**
- Low rolling stool with back support
- Adjustable height
- Easy mobility around client

**Work Surface:**
- Client foot should be at a height preventing neck flexion
- Use pillows or supports to raise client's hands/feet
- Good lighting to prevent leaning forward

### General Salon

**Flooring:**
- Anti-fatigue mats at every station
- Quality footwear on top of mats
- Mat where you stand most, not just where convenient

**Storage:**
- Frequently used items at waist to shoulder height
- No heavy items overhead requiring reaching
- Rolling carts to bring supplies to you

## Throughout Your Day

### Start of Shift

**Pre-work routine (5 minutes):**

1. **Shoulder rolls** – 10 forward, 10 backward
2. **Neck rotations** – 5 each direction
3. **Chest stretch** – Doorway stretch, 30 seconds
4. **Hip circles** – 10 each direction

1. Drop your shoulders away from ears
2. Roll shoulder blades back and down
3. Tuck chin slightly

**Between every client—no exceptions**

### During Services

- Use arm strength, not back
- Take breaks to stand upright

**Blow-drying:**
