# Posture for Pregnant Athletes: Staying Active Safely

> **Yes, You Can Stay Active:** If you were athletic before pregnancy, you can likely continue being active—with modifications. Here's how to adapt your training while respecting the profound changes in your body.

## Key Takeaways

- Athletic women can generally continue exercising during pregnancy
- Modifications become necessary as pregnancy progresses
- Posture changes require training adaptations
- Listen to your body—it's communicating important information
- Work with healthcare providers who understand athletes

---

## Your Body Is Changing

### First Trimester

- Fatigue may be significant
- Nausea affects some women
- Relaxin hormone begins increasing
- External changes minimal
- Performance may drop before "showing"

### Second Trimester

- Often the "best" trimester for activity
- Energy typically improves
- Center of gravity shifting
- Ligaments becoming looser
- Visible pregnancy changes posture needs

### Third Trimester

- Balance significantly affected
- Breathing may be limited
- Weight increase affects all movement
- Rest becomes more important
- Focus shifts to birth preparation

---

## Posture Changes Affecting Athletes

### Center of Gravity Shift

As belly grows:
- Weight moves forward
- Compensatory lean backward common
- Balance affected in all activities
- Fall risk increases

**Adaptations:**
- Wider stance in all activities
- No activities with high fall risk
- Support for balance exercises
- Awareness of new center of gravity

### Ligament Laxity

Relaxin hormone:
- Loosens all ligaments
- Increases flexibility (but at cost of stability)
- Makes joints more vulnerable
- Peaks in third trimester

**Adaptations:**
- Reduce stretching intensity (don't go to end range)
- Focus on stability over flexibility
- Support joints in training
- Avoid overstretching—it's easy now but not protective

### Spinal Changes

- Lumbar lordosis increases (low back curve)
- Thoracic kyphosis may increase
- Rib cage expands
- Pelvis tilts anteriorly

**Adaptations:**
- Core work that's pregnancy-safe
- Avoid excessive back extension
- Side-lying for many exercises
- Attention to alignment in all activities

## Modifying Your Training

### Running

**First trimester:**
- Usually continue as normal
- Reduce if fatigued
- Stay hydrated

**Second trimester:**
- May need to slow pace
- Walk breaks as needed
- Supportive belly band helpful
- Monitor for pelvic floor issues

**Third trimester:**
- Many transition to walking
- Some continue running until late
- No rules—listen to your body
- Stop if uncomfortable

**Stop running if:**
- Pelvic pain
- Leaking urine
- Vaginal bleeding
- Any concerning symptoms

### Strength Training

**Safe with modifications:**
- Reduce loads as needed
- Avoid supine (on back) after first trimester
- Modify for growing belly
- Focus on functional movements

**Great exercises:**
- Squats (wider stance)
- Modified deadlifts
- Rows and pulling
- Side-lying work
- Supported lunges

**Avoid or modify:**
- Heavy lifting to failure
- Exercises lying flat on back
- Exercises causing coning/doming of abs
- High fall risk movements

### Yoga

**Generally excellent during pregnancy:**
- Improves flexibility (carefully)
- Builds body awareness
- Reduces stress
- Prepares for birth

**Modifications needed:**
- No deep twists involving belly
- Modify inversions
- Avoid hot yoga
- No prone (on belly) poses after first trimester
- Block and prop support

### Swimming

**Ideal pregnancy exercise:**
- No impact
- Weight supported
- Full body workout
- Comfortable for most

**Considerations:**
- Pool temperature not too hot
- No diving
- Watch for balance poolside
- Breast stroke may strain pubic symphysis

### Cycling

**Indoor/Stationary:**
- Generally safe throughout
- Upright bike preferred
- May need handlebar adjustment
- Monitor exertion

**Outdoor:**
- Fall risk is concern
- Most stop by mid-pregnancy
- Mountain biking/high risk cycling should stop early
- Individual decision with provider input

## Core Training During Pregnancy

### What Changes

- Abdominal muscles stretch
- Diastasis recti may develop
- Traditional "ab exercises" often inappropriate
- Core still important for support

### Safe Core Work

**Good options:**
- Breathing exercises
- Pelvic floor engagement
- Modified dead bugs
- Side planks (modified)
- Bird-dogs
- Pallof press

**Avoid:**
- Crunches/sit-ups
- Full planks (later pregnancy)
- Any exercise causing coning
- Intense core compression

### Watching for Diastasis

During exercise, look for:
- "Coning" or "tenting" of abdomen
- Visible bulge down midline
- Inability to maintain tension

If you see this, modify or stop that exercise.

## Pelvic Floor Considerations

### For Athletes

Athletes aren't immune to pelvic floor issues:
- High-impact sports increase risk
- Strong abs aren't same as strong pelvic floor
- Previous issues may worsen
- New issues may develop

### Signs to Watch

- Leaking urine during exercise
- Pelvic heaviness or pressure
- Pain in pelvic region
- Difficulty controlling gas or stool

### What Helps

- Pelvic floor exercises (Kegels, properly done)
- Reducing impact if issues occur
- Exhaling on exertion
- Seeing pelvic floor PT if problems arise

---

## Competition During Pregnancy

### Considerations

- Risk vs. benefit analysis
- Provider input
- Sport-specific risks
- What are the stakes?

### General Guidance

- No contact sports
- Reduce intensity expectations
- Modify goals
- Some athletes compete well into pregnancy, others step back early

### Postpartum Comeback

- Recovery takes time
- Return gradually
- Address any lingering issues
- Patience with changed body

---

## Warning Signs to Stop

### Stop Exercise Immediately If

- Vaginal bleeding
- Fluid leaking
- Contractions
- Dizziness or fainting
- Chest pain
- Calf pain or swelling
- Headache with vision changes
- Decreased fetal movement

### See Provider If

- Persistent pain anywhere
- Unusual fatigue
- Pelvic floor symptoms
- Concerns about activity level
- Anything that worries you

---

## Working with Providers

### Finding the Right Team

- OB/midwife who understands athletes
- Physical therapist experienced with pregnant athletes
- Coach who can modify training
- Trainers with prenatal certification

### Communication

- Be honest about your activity level
- Ask specific questions
- Report any concerns
- Don't assume silence means approval

### What to Discuss

- Your specific sports/activities
- Any history of complications
- Current symptoms or concerns
- Training modifications needed

---

## Mental Health Aspects

### Identity Shifts

For athletes, reduced capacity can be hard:
- Identity tied to performance
- Frustration with limitations
- Uncertainty about postpartum return
- Comparison to pre-pregnancy self

### Healthy Perspectives

- This is temporary
- Building a human is its own athletic feat
- Modified activity is still valuable
- You'll return (changed but capable)

### Support

- Connect with other pregnant/postpartum athletes
- Work with mental health professional if struggling
- Adjust expectations compassionately
- Find joy in what you CAN do

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will exercise hurt my baby?

For most healthy pregnancies, exercise is safe and beneficial. Discuss your specific situation and any risk factors with your provider.

### How much should I reduce my intensity?

The "talk test" is useful—you should be able to hold a conversation. Heart rate guidelines are less useful since heart rate changes during pregnancy.

### Can I still compete?

Depends on the sport, your health, and the risks involved. Many athletes continue some competition with modifications; others step back. There's no universal answer.

### When can I return to full training postpartum?

Typically 6+ weeks minimum, often longer. Pelvic floor and core recovery matter. Return should be gradual. Some athletes take 6-12 months for full return.

### I was really fit—why is this so hard?

Pregnancy is a significant physical undertaking. Fitness helps, but doesn't make pregnancy easy. Be compassionate with yourself.
