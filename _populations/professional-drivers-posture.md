# Professional Driver Posture

> **Hours Behind the Wheel:** Commercial driving means extended sitting, vibration, and limited movement options. Protect your back with proper seat setup and strategic habits.

---

## The Professional Driving Challenge

### What Makes It Hard

- **10-14 hour days** in seat
- **Whole-body vibration** - fatigues muscles
- **Limited movement** - can't get up when you want
- **Repeated entry/exit** - climbing in/out
- **Varied vehicles** - not always your truck
- **Loading/unloading** - additional physical demands

### Common Problems

- Lower back pain (most common)
- Sciatica symptoms
- Neck and shoulder tension
- Hip stiffness
- Leg circulation issues

---

## Seat Adjustment

### Getting It Right Matters

You'll spend 8-14 hours in this position—invest time in setup.

### Seat Position

**Height:**
- See road clearly
- Knees slightly below hips
- Feet reach pedals comfortably

**Distance:**
- Full pedal depression without stretching
- Slight knee bend when leg extended
- Not reaching for steering wheel

**Angle:**
- Back slightly reclined (100-110 degrees)
- Not too upright (fatiguing)
- Not too reclined (reaching for wheel)

### Lumbar Support

**Critical for long-haul:**
- Adjust built-in support if available
- Add aftermarket support if not
- Should fill lower back curve
- Not too aggressive (pushing you forward)

### Steering Wheel Position

**Where possible:**
- Adjust height and reach
- Arms slightly bent when holding
- Shoulders relaxed
- Hands at 9 and 3 (or lower)

### Mirror Position

**Reduce twisting:**
- All mirrors visible without straining
- Minimize head turning needed
- Set when properly seated

---

## Sitting Posture While Driving

### The Basics

- Back against lumbar support
- Shoulders relaxed
- Head back against headrest
- Both hands on wheel
- Knees at comfortable angle

### What Happens Over Hours

**Fatigue sets in:**
- Slouching begins
- Lean to one side
- Hunch forward
- Tension builds

**Combat with:**
- Regular position resets
- Micro-movements in seat
- Breaks when possible

---

## Movement During Driving

### What You Can Do

**Shift position:**
- Move in your seat
- Shift weight side to side
- Adjust pelvis position

**Activate muscles:**
- Squeeze and release glutes
- Core engagement briefly
- Shoulder blade squeezes

**Upper body:**
- Shoulder shrugs (briefly)
- Neck stretches at stops
- Arm position changes

---

## Required Breaks

### Making the Most of Them

**Every break:**
- Get out of vehicle
- Walk around entire vehicle
- Stretch (routine below)
- Don't sit during breaks

### Stretching at Stops

**Essential stretches:**

**Hip flexors:**
- Lunge position
- 30 seconds each leg
- Critical after sitting

**Lower back:**
- Standing back extension
- Hands on hips, lean back
- Hold 10 seconds, repeat

**Hamstrings:**
- Foot on step
- Lean forward
- 30 seconds each leg

**Neck:**
- Tilts each direction
- Rotation each direction
- 20 seconds each

**Shoulders:**
- Arm across body
- Shoulder rolls
- Reach up and stretch

---

## Entry and Exit

### Climbing In/Out

**Repeated daily = cumulative strain**

**Better technique:**

**Getting in:**
1. Face the seat
2. Sit down first
3. Then swing legs in
4. Use handles for support

**Getting out:**
1. Swing legs out
2. Face outward
3. Step down (don't jump)
4. Use handles

### Three-Point Contact

- Always maintain three contact points
- Don't rush
- Watch for slippery surfaces
- Use available handles

---

## Loading and Unloading

### Physical Demands

Many driving jobs include:
- Lifting and carrying
- Dollies and carts
- Loading docks
- Customer deliveries

### Protect Your Back

- Use proper lifting technique
- Use equipment available
- Get help when needed
- Don't rush

## Vibration Effects

### Whole-Body Vibration

**Long-term exposure:**
- Accelerates disc degeneration
- Muscle fatigue
- Back pain

**Mitigation:**
- Quality seat with suspension
- Maintain tire pressure
- Avoid rough roads when possible
- Breaks to recover

---

## Health Maintenance

### Staying Fit for Driving

**Exercise is essential:**
- Counters effects of sitting
- Maintains flexibility
- Strengthens support muscles

**Key areas:**
- Core strength
- Hip flexibility
