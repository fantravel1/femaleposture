# Ergonomics for Short Women (Under 5'4"): Complete Guide

> **The Problem:** Standard office furniture is designed for someone 5'8"-5'10". If you're under 5'4", everything is too high, too deep, and forces you into poor posture. Here's how to fix it.

---

## Why Standard Setup Doesn't Work

### The Reality of "Standard" Furniture

- Desk height: 29-30 inches (designed for taller people)
- Chair seat height: Often too high even at lowest setting
- Chair seat depth: Too deep for shorter legs
- Monitor height: Based on taller eye levels
- Keyboard placement: Assumes longer arms

### What This Causes

When you're shorter in standard furniture:
- Feet dangle (no floor support)
- Legs don't bend 90 degrees
- Arms reach up to keyboard
- Back doesn't reach chair back properly
- You lean forward to see/reach

---

## The Chair Problem (And Solutions)

### Common Issues

- Lowest setting still too high
- Seat pan too deep (cuts behind knees)
- Back support hits wrong area
- Arms rests too high

### Solutions

**Option 1: Get a Chair Made for Petite Women**

Some manufacturers make petite-sized chairs with:
- Lower minimum height
- Shorter seat depth (16-17" vs. 18-20")
- Proportionate back support
- Lower armrest range

**Option 2: Modify a Standard Chair**

- **Too high:** Add a footrest (essential)
- **Seat too deep:** Use a lumbar pillow to push you forward, or add a cushion behind you
- **Back support wrong:** Adjust lumbar support or add external support
- **Armrests wrong:** Remove them or use padding

**Option 3: Use a Footrest**

This is often the most practical solution:
- Allows chair at proper height for desk
- Supports feet at angle
- Maintains thigh-to-floor angle
- Can tilt or remain flat

---

## Footrest: Your Most Important Accessory

### Why It's Essential

When your feet dangle:
- Blood flow to legs is reduced
- Thighs press on seat edge
- Lower back doesn't maintain curve
- You shift and fidget more

### What to Look For

- **Height:** Adjustable to your needs (often 3-6 inches)
- **Tilt:** Option to angle can be more comfortable
- **Size:** Wide enough for both feet comfortably
- **Surface:** Non-slip

### DIY Options

- Sturdy box
- Old textbooks stacked
- Yoga blocks
- Small step stool

### Ideal Setup with Footrest

1. Set chair so thighs are parallel to floor (with footrest)
2. Knees at approximately 90 degrees
3. Feet flat on footrest
4. Small gap between seat edge and back of knees

## Desk Height Solutions

### The Problem

Standard desks are 29-30 inches high. For someone 5'2", keyboard at this height means:
- Shoulders elevated
- Arms angled up
- Wrist strain
- Neck and shoulder tension

### Solutions

**Option 1: Adjustable Height Desk**

- Can lower to appropriate height (often 25-27" for petite users)
- Sit-stand desks often have good range
- Investment worth considering

**Option 2: Keyboard Tray**

- Pulls out below desk level
- Allows keyboard at proper height
- Keeps desk surface for other items
- Look for adjustable height and tilt

**Option 3: Raise Your Chair + Use Footrest**

- Chair goes up to bring you to desk height
- Footrest supports your feet
- Works with existing furniture

---

## Monitor Positioning

### Standard Advice (Adjusted)

"Top of monitor at eye level" still applies, but:
- You may need monitor LOWER than typical
- Arm reach is shorter—monitor may need to be closer
- Larger monitors may be too close at proper distance

### Solutions

**Monitor too high:**
- Remove monitor stand
- Use a lower monitor arm
- Place monitor directly on desk

**Monitor too far:**
- Move closer to desk
- Ensure you can see clearly without leaning forward
- Consider monitor arm for flexibility

**Laptop users:**
- Laptop stand may be too high
- Separate keyboard + lower stand works better
- Or laptop at desk level + external monitor

---

## Keyboard and Mouse

### The Issue

With arms and hands that are proportionally smaller:
- Standard keyboards may feel large
- Mouse may be too wide to grip comfortably
- Reaching for mouse can strain shoulder

### Solutions

**Compact keyboards:**
- Eliminate number pad
- Brings mouse closer
- Better for smaller hands

**Smaller mice:**
- Look for "petite" or "compact" options
- Should fit your palm comfortably
- Shouldn't require stretching to click

**Keyboard tray:**
- Brings keyboard to proper height
- Allows negative tilt (front higher than back)
- Reduces wrist extension
