      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Most posture advice ignores that women's bodies are different. Standard ergonomic guidelines are based on average male dimensions. Pregnancy, postpartum, menopause—these major life events that affect half the population are often treated as afterthoughts.</p>

      <p>FemalePosture.com exists to fill that gap with practical, evidence-based guidance that addresses women's real experiences.</p>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>

      <h3>Women-Focused Approach</h3>
      <p>Every article is written with women's bodies in mind. We address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anatomical differences that affect posture</li>
        <li>Pregnancy and postpartum changes</li>
        <li>Menopause and bone health</li>
        <li>Breastfeeding and baby carrying</li>
        <li>Ergonomics for typically smaller frames</li>
        <li>Bra fitting and breast support considerations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Life Stage Awareness</h3>
      <p>Your posture needs change throughout life. We provide guidance for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teen years (developing bodies, backpacks, phones)</li>
        <li>Young adults (desk careers, early prevention)</li>
        <li>Pregnancy (trimester-by-trimester guidance)</li>
        <li>Postpartum (recovery and new challenges)</li>
        <li>Perimenopause and menopause (bone and joint changes)</li>
        <li>Aging well (maintaining independence)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Practical and Actionable</h3>
      <p>We don't just explain problems—we provide solutions. Every condition page includes exercises, every activity page includes practical tips you can use today.</p>

      <h3>Evidence-Based</h3>
      <p>Our content is based on current research and best practices. We cite sources, acknowledge uncertainty, and update content as science evolves.</p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Posture is not about perfection.</strong> "Perfect" static posture isn't the goal. Movement, variety, and awareness matter more.</li>
        <li><strong>Small consistent actions beat occasional big efforts.</strong> Daily habits create lasting change.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement is medicine.</strong> The best posture is your next posture. Keep moving.</li>
        <li><strong>Information should be accessible.</strong> Clear, practical guidance—not jargon and fear.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional help is valuable.</strong> We provide information, not diagnosis. See a provider when you need one.</li>
      </ul>
