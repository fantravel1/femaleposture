# Physical Therapy for Posture Correction

Physical therapy (PT) is the gold standard for evidence-based posture correction. Unlike passive treatments, PT teaches you to actively correct and maintain proper alignment through exercise, education, and movement retraining.

For women, PT offers specialized approaches addressing pregnancy, postpartum recovery, pelvic floor dysfunction, and other female-specific concerns that affect posture.

## What the Research Shows

### Effectiveness for Posture Issues

Physical therapy has strong evidence for treating:
- **Chronic low back pain**: Systematic reviews show PT is more effective than general practitioner care
- **Neck pain and forward head posture**: Manual therapy combined with exercise shows significant improvement
- **Postpartum recovery**: Pelvic floor PT reduces symptoms and improves function
- **Scoliosis**: Specialized PT (Schroth method) can reduce curve progression in adolescents

### Why PT Works

Physical therapy addresses posture through multiple mechanisms:
1. **Manual therapy**: Releases tight structures, mobilizes stiff joints
2. **Therapeutic exercise**: Strengthens weak muscles, stretches tight ones
3. **Neuromuscular re-education**: Retrains movement patterns
4. **Education**: Teaches body mechanics and self-management
5. **Modalities**: Pain relief to enable better movement

## What Happens in PT for Posture

### Initial Evaluation

**What to expect (60-90 minutes):**

**Health history review:**
- Current symptoms and concerns
- Medical history
- Previous treatments
- Lifestyle factors (work, activities, sleep)
- Goals for treatment

**Physical examination:**
- Postural assessment (standing, sitting, walking)
- Range of motion testing
- Strength testing
- Movement quality analysis
- Special tests for specific conditions
- Palpation of muscles and joints

**Functional assessment:**
- How you move in daily activities
- Work-related movements
- Exercise or sport movements

**Assessment findings:**
- Explanation of what's causing your posture issues
- Identification of tight/weak muscles
- Contributing factors
- Prognosis

### Treatment Sessions

**Typical session (45-60 minutes):**

**Manual therapy:**
- Soft tissue mobilization
- Joint mobilization
- Myofascial release
- Trigger point work
- Muscle energy techniques

**Therapeutic exercise:**
- Strengthening exercises
- Stretching program
- Stability work
- Movement retraining
- Progression of home program

**Neuromuscular re-education:**
- Postural awareness training
- Movement pattern correction
- Balance training
- Coordination work

**Education:**
- Understanding your condition
- Ergonomic guidance
- Self-management strategies
- Activity modification

### Home Exercise Program

**Critical component:**
Your PT will prescribe exercises to do between sessions. Adherence to home exercises significantly impacts outcomes.

**Typical program includes:**
- Daily stretches (5-10 minutes)
- Strengthening exercises (15-20 minutes, 3-5x/week)
- Postural awareness cues
- Ergonomic changes

## Types of Physical Therapy for Women

## Finding the Right PT

### Credentials to Look For

**Basic requirements:**

### Questions to Ask

**Before scheduling:**
- Do you treat [your specific condition]?
- What is your experience with women's posture issues?
- Do you have specialized training in [pelvic floor, pregnancy, etc.]?
- What does a typical treatment plan look like?
- How long are sessions?
- What is your approach to posture correction?

**At first visit:**
