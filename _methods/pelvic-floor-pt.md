# Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy for Posture

The pelvic floor is the hidden foundation of posture. This muscular sling at the base of your pelvis works with your deep core to support your spine, organs, and every movement you make. When it's not functioning well, posture suffers—and poor posture makes pelvic floor problems worse.

Pelvic floor physical therapy is specialized treatment that addresses this crucial connection, essential for women at every life stage.

## The Pelvic Floor-Posture Connection

### What Is the Pelvic Floor?

A hammock-like group of muscles spanning from pubic bone to tailbone, the pelvic floor:
- Supports pelvic organs (bladder, uterus, rectum)
- Controls continence (bladder and bowel)
- Contributes to sexual function
- Works with deep core for stability
- Responds to breathing and movement

### How It Affects Posture

**The pelvic floor is part of the "inner unit"** that stabilizes the spine:
- Diaphragm (top)
- Transverse abdominis (front/sides)
- Multifidus (back)
- Pelvic floor (bottom)

These muscles work together like a canister. When one doesn't function, the whole system compensates.

**Pelvic floor dysfunction leads to:**
- Altered core stability
- Compensatory muscle patterns
- Changes in pelvic position
- Breathing pattern changes
- Overall postural shifts

### How Posture Affects the Pelvic Floor

The relationship works both ways:

**Slouched posture:**
- Increases pressure on pelvic floor
- Shortens/tightens muscles
- Compromises support
- Worsens incontinence

**Excessive arch (anterior pelvic tilt):**
- Lengthens pelvic floor
- May weaken support
- Alters muscle function

**Good alignment:**
- Optimal pelvic floor position
- Balanced pressure
- Best function

## When Pelvic Floor PT Is Needed

### Common Indications

**Urinary issues:**
- Stress incontinence (leaking with cough, sneeze, exercise)
- Urge incontinence (sudden strong urge)
- Frequent urination
- Difficulty emptying bladder

**Bowel issues:**
- Fecal incontinence
- Constipation
- Difficulty emptying bowels

**Pelvic pain:**
- Pain with intercourse
- Vulvar pain
- Coccyx (tailbone) pain
- Pelvic pressure

**Prolapse:**
- Feeling of heaviness or bulging
- Organ descent (bladder, uterus, rectum)

**Core/posture issues:**
- Diastasis recti
- Postpartum core weakness
- Low back pain with pelvic floor component
- Core dysfunction despite exercise

### Life Stage Triggers

**Pregnancy:**
- Pelvic girdle pain
- Incontinence
- Preparing for birth

**Postpartum:**
- Recovery from vaginal or cesarean birth
- Return to exercise safely
- Addressing symptoms

**Perimenopause/Menopause:**
- New or worsening symptoms
- Prolapse
- Hormonal changes affecting tissues

**Any age:**
- After pelvic surgery
- Chronic conditions
- Athletes with symptoms
- Anyone with pelvic floor concerns

## What Pelvic Floor PT Involves

### Initial Evaluation

**History (detailed):**
- Symptoms and onset
- Bladder and bowel habits
- Sexual function concerns
- Pregnancy/birth history
- Medical and surgical history
- Current exercise and activities
- Goals for treatment

**External assessment:**
- Posture evaluation
- Breathing patterns
- Hip and spine mobility
- Core function
- Movement patterns

**Internal assessment (with consent):**
- Pelvic floor muscle tone
- Strength and endurance
- Coordination
- Pain or tenderness
- Prolapse grading (if applicable)

**Important:** Internal exam is gold standard but not always required. Some PTs use external-only approaches, and you can always decline.

### Treatment Approaches

**Pelvic floor muscle training:**
- Learning correct contraction
- Strengthening (if weak)
- Relaxation (if tight)
- Coordination training
- Functional integration

**Manual therapy:**
- External techniques (hips, pelvis, spine)
- Internal techniques (if appropriate)
- Myofascial release
- Trigger point work
- Scar tissue mobilization

**Biofeedback:**
- Surface EMG (external sensors)
- Internal sensors (if appropriate)
- Visual feedback for training
- Helps learn correct muscle use

**Education:**
- Bladder/bowel habits
- Posture and alignment
- Breathing coordination
- Lifestyle modifications
- Activity modifications

**Therapeutic exercise:**
- Core stability training
- Hip strengthening
- Global strengthening
- Flexibility work
- Functional movement training

## The Posture-Focused Approach

### Assessing Pelvic Position

Your PT will evaluate:
- Anterior vs. posterior pelvic tilt
- Pelvic rotation or asymmetry
- Relationship to rib cage
- Standing vs. sitting posture
- Dynamic alignment (during movement)

### Correcting Alignment Issues

**Anterior pelvic tilt (common):**
- Hip flexor lengthening
- Glute strengthening
- Core training
- Postural awareness

**Posterior pelvic tilt:**
- Hip extension mobility
- Lumbar curve restoration
- Different exercise approach

**Asymmetry:**
- Identifying contributing factors
- Muscle imbalance correction
- Movement retraining

### Breathing Retraining

**Critical connection:** The diaphragm and pelvic floor move together. Dysfunctional breathing affects pelvic floor function and vice versa.

**What you'll learn:**
- 360-degree breathing
- Pelvic floor-diaphragm coordination
- Breath during movement
- Avoiding breath-holding patterns

### Core Integration

**Beyond Kegels:**
- Coordinating pelvic floor with transverse abdominis
- Timing with movement
- Functional core stability
- Safe return to demanding activities

## Treatment for Specific Conditions

### Stress Urinary Incontinence

**Leaking with cough, sneeze, jump, lift:**
- Pelvic floor strengthening
- Coordination training (the "knack")
- Core-pelvic floor integration
- Posture optimization
- Activity modification

**Research shows:** Supervised pelvic floor muscle training is first-line treatment, more effective than medication or no treatment.

### Pelvic Organ Prolapse

**Feeling of bulging or heaviness:**
- Pelvic floor strengthening
- Posture to reduce pressure
- Breathing patterns
- Lifting mechanics
- Pessary fitting (some PTs)
- Activity modifications

**Evidence supports:** Conservative management can significantly reduce symptoms.

### Diastasis Recti

**Abdominal separation:**
- Internal oblique and transverse abdominis training
- Pelvic floor coordination
- Progressive core loading
- Posture correction
- Safe exercise guidance

**Connection:** Diastasis and pelvic floor dysfunction often co-exist and must be addressed together.

### Pelvic Pain

**Pain in pelvic region:**
- Often involves overactive (tight) pelvic floor
- Relaxation training
- Manual therapy
- Desensitization
- Pain education
- Breathing and stress management

### Postpartum Recovery

**Comprehensive approach:**
- Pelvic floor assessment and training
- Diastasis evaluation
- Core restoration
- Return to exercise guidance
- Addressing symptoms
- Posture correction for feeding/carrying

## Finding a Pelvic Floor PT

### Credentials

**Look for:**
- Licensed physical therapist (PT, DPT)
- Additional training in pelvic health
- Certifications indicate expertise:
  - PRPC (Pelvic Rehabilitation Practitioner Certification)
  - WCS (Women's Health Clinical Specialist) - ABPTS board certified
  - CAPP-Pelvic (Certificate of Achievement in Pelvic Physical Therapy)
  - Herman & Wallace trained

### Where to Find

**Resources:**
- Pelvic Rehab (pelvicrehab.com) - practitioner directory
- APTA (apta.org) - women's health section
- Herman & Wallace - find a provider
- Ask OB/GYN or midwife for referrals

### Questions to Ask

**Before scheduling:**
- What is your training in pelvic floor therapy?
- Do you do internal exams? (If relevant to you)
- What does a typical treatment plan look like?
- How long are sessions?
- Do you have experience with [your condition]?

### What to Expect First Visit

**Duration:** Usually 60-90 minutes

**Be prepared to discuss:**
- Detailed symptom history
- Bladder/bowel habits
- Birth history
- Goals

**The exam:**
- Explain what you're comfortable with
- You can decline internal exam
- You control the process

## Self-Care Between Sessions

### Basic Pelvic Floor Awareness

**Finding your pelvic floor:**
1. Sit or lie comfortably
2. Imagine stopping the flow of urine
3. Or imagine picking up a blueberry with your vagina
4. Feel a gentle lift and squeeze
5. Fully release

**Important:** Don't actually stop urine flow as exercise—just use this to identify the muscles.

### Posture for Pelvic Floor Health

**Optimal sitting:**
- Both sits bones weighted
- Slight lumbar curve
- Ribs over pelvis
- Not slouched, not over-arched

**Optimal standing:**
- Weight balanced over feet
- Pelvis neutral
- Stacked alignment
- Relaxed breathing

### Lifestyle Factors

**Support your pelvic floor:**
- Stay hydrated (don't restrict fluids)
- Maintain regular bowel habits
- Avoid chronic straining
- Manage cough/allergies
- Maintain healthy weight
- Don't "just in case" pee

## Common Myths Debunked

### "Kegels are always the answer"

**Reality:** Sometimes the pelvic floor is too tight, not weak. Kegels can make this worse. Assessment determines what's needed.

### "Leaking is normal after having babies"

**Reality:** Common, but not normal or inevitable. Treatment is effective at any point postpartum.

### "Pelvic floor PT is just for postpartum women"

**Reality:** Beneficial at any age or life stage, including pre-pregnancy and menopause.

### "Internal exam is always required"

**Reality:** Many conditions can be addressed externally. You always have choice about internal assessment.

### "It's embarrassing/too personal"

**Reality:** Pelvic floor PTs are specially trained professionals. They create comfortable, respectful environments. Your concerns are medical, not embarrassing.
