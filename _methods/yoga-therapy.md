# Yoga Therapy for Posture

Yoga therapy takes the principles of yoga and applies them therapeutically to address specific health conditions, including postural problems. Unlike group yoga classes, yoga therapy offers individualized assessment and customized practices designed for your unique body, conditions, and goals.

For women with complex postural issues, pain conditions, or those who haven't found success with standard approaches, yoga therapy provides a holistic path to better alignment.

## What Is Yoga Therapy?

### Definition

Yoga therapy is the professional application of yogic principles and practices for health and wellness. A yoga therapist assesses your condition and creates personalized protocols using:
- Postures (asana)
- Breathing practices (pranayama)
- Meditation and relaxation
- Lifestyle recommendations
- Philosophy and mindset work

### How It Differs from Yoga Classes

| Aspect | Group Yoga Class | Yoga Therapy |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Assessment** | None or minimal | Comprehensive intake |
| **Approach** | One-size-fits-all | Individualized |
| **Focus** | General practice | Your specific condition |
| **Modifications** | Limited | Extensive |
| **Progress** | Self-directed | Guided progression |
| **Scope** | Physical practice primarily | Whole-person approach |
| **Setting** | Group | Usually individual |

### Credentials

**Look for:**
- C-IAYT (Certified Yoga Therapist) - International Association of Yoga Therapists
- Requires 1,000+ hours of training beyond basic yoga teacher certification

### Comprehensive Assessment

**Your first session includes:**
- Health history review
- Postural observation

**Unlike quick assessments:**
A yoga therapist takes time to understand not just your posture, but your life, stress, history, and what contributes to your patterns.

### Root Cause Approach

**Yoga therapy looks beyond symptoms:**
- What activities reinforce your pattern?
- What emotional patterns might contribute?
- What lifestyle factors play a role?
- What is your relationship with your body?

**Posture is seen as:**
- Expression of physical habits
- Response to emotional states
- Adaptation to life demands
- Part of whole-person functioning

### Personalized Practice

**Asana (postures):**
- Specific poses for your imbalances
- Modifications for your body

- Specific practices for your needs
- Breath awareness throughout movement

**Relaxation:**
- Releasing habitual tension
