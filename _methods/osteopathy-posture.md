# Osteopathy for Posture

Osteopathy is a form of manual medicine that views the body as an integrated whole, with structure and function deeply interrelated. Osteopathic practitioners use hands-on techniques to address musculoskeletal issues, including postural problems, with attention to how they affect overall health.

For women seeking a whole-body approach to posture that considers overall wellness, osteopathy offers a unique perspective.

## What Is Osteopathy?

### Philosophy

Osteopathy was founded by Andrew Taylor Still in the 1870s on key principles:

1. **The body is a unit** - All systems interconnect
2. **Structure and function are interrelated** - How the body is organized affects how it works
3. **The body has self-healing mechanisms** - Treatment supports natural healing
4. **Rational treatment is based on these principles** - Understanding the whole guides care

### Types of Osteopathic Practitioners

**In the United States:**

**DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine):**
- Fully licensed physicians
- Can prescribe medication, perform surgery
- Complete medical training plus OMT
- Practice in all medical specialties
- Many don't use OMT in practice

**Finding a DO who practices OMT:**
- Specifically seek those who include manipulation
- Ask about their hands-on approach
- Some specialize in neuromusculoskeletal medicine

**Internationally:**

In many countries (UK, Europe, Australia), osteopaths are not medical doctors but licensed manual therapists who use manipulation and other hands-on techniques exclusively.

### Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT)

**OMT encompasses many techniques:**
- Soft tissue manipulation
- Myofascial release
- Muscle energy techniques
- Counterstrain
- Cranial-sacral techniques
- High-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust
- Facilitated positional release

## How Osteopathy Addresses Posture

### Whole-Body Assessment

**Osteopaths look at:**
- Posture and alignment
- Movement patterns
- Tissue quality
- Restrictions throughout body
- Compensatory patterns
- Connections between areas

### The Osteopathic Perspective

**Posture is seen as:**
- Expression of overall function
- Connected to all body systems
- Affected by breathing, circulation, nerves
- Part of self-regulating system

**Treatment aims to:**

- Balance tensions
- Support self-healing
- Address whole system

### Common Findings in Posture Problems

**Osteopaths often find:**
- Fascial restrictions
- Joint restrictions
- Muscle imbalances
- Visceral tensions (organ restrictions)
- Cranial-sacral patterns
- Compensatory chains

## What Treatment Involves

### Initial Evaluation

**Comprehensive assessment (45-60 minutes):**
- Complete health history

- Then relax while being stretched
- Effective for muscle restrictions

**Counterstrain:**
- Positioning in comfort
- Holding to release tender points
- Very gentle approach

**Myofascial release:**
- Sustained pressure on fascia
- Following tissue response
- Creates lasting change

**Cranial techniques:**
- Very subtle
- Addresses cranial-sacral system
- Gentle but can be profound

**HVLA (high-velocity thrust):**
- Similar to chiropractic adjustment
- Rapid, small movement
- Joint mobilization

### Treatment Course

**Typical patterns:**
- Initial series: Weekly for 4-6 weeks
- Reassessment and adjustment
- Spacing out as improving
- Maintenance as needed
