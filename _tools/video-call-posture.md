# Video Call Posture Guide

> **The Camera Makes It Worse:** Video calls often create posture problems—we crane toward the camera, hunch to see ourselves, and sit rigidly for hours. Here's how to look professional without destroying your neck.

---

## The Video Call Posture Problem

### Common Issues

- Leaning toward screen to appear engaged
- Looking down at laptop camera
- Hunching to fit in frame
- Sitting rigid without movement
- Multiple hours of video calls daily

### Physical Consequences

- Neck strain (forward head)
- Upper back pain
- Shoulder tension
- Eye strain
- Fatigue

---

## Camera Setup

### Camera Height

**Ideal:** At or slightly above eye level

**Why:** Looking down at camera = looking down = neck strain

**Solutions:**
- External webcam on top of monitor
- Laptop stand to raise built-in camera
- Stack of books under laptop (temporary)
- Monitor arm at proper height

### Camera Distance

**Ideal:** Arm's length from face

**Too close:** Have to lean back, feels invasive
**Too far:** Lean forward to be seen

**In frame:** Head, shoulders, some of upper chest

### Camera Angle

**Ideal:** Straight on, slight downward look

**Avoid:**
- Camera pointing up from below (unflattering and promotes slouch)
- Camera too high (craning up)
- Camera off to the side (twisting to look)

---

## Desk Setup for Video Calls

### Monitor Position

- Camera at eye level (see above)
- Monitor at comfortable reading distance
- Gallery view/participant video near camera
- Reduce need to look away from camera area

### Self-View

**The trap:** Constantly watching yourself leads to adjusting, tension

**Better approach:**
- Hide self-view when possible
- Pin the speaker to reduce eye movement
- Glance at self occasionally for posture check, then ignore

### Keyboard and Mouse

- Same ergonomic position as regular work
- Don't lean forward for calls
- Keep arms relaxed

---

## Body Position

### Good Video Call Posture

**Spine:**
- Sitting tall (but not rigid)
- Natural curves maintained
- Back against chair support

**Shoulders:**
- Relaxed, not up by ears
- Back, not rounded forward
- Even (not twisted)

**Head:**
- Neutral (not jutting forward)
- Chin level
- Eyes can look at camera without strain

**Core:**
- Gently engaged
- Providing support
- Not collapsed

### Signs of Bad Posture (Check Yourself)

In the self-view, look for:
- [ ] Chin jutting forward
- [ ] Shoulders hunched up
- [ ] Visible slouching
- [ ] Head tilted
- [ ] Leaning to one side

---

## During the Call

### Movement is Key

**Every 20-30 minutes:**
- Shift position
- Roll shoulders
- Adjust posture
- Stand briefly if possible

**Camera-off moments:**
- Stand up
- Stretch
- Walk around
- Rest eyes

### Avoiding the Lean

**When engaged in conversation:**
- Resist urge to lean toward screen
- Nod and engage facially instead
- Stay back in chair
- Remember: they can see you fine

### Eyes and Screen

**Reduce strain:**
- 20-20-20 rule (every 20 min, look 20 ft away for 20 sec)
- Blink regularly (we forget on screens)
- Position documents near camera
- Reduce glare on screen

---

## Lighting for Posture

### Why Lighting Matters

Poor lighting leads to:
- Leaning toward screen (to be seen)
- Squinting (tension)
- Looking up/down at light sources

### Good Lighting Setup

- Light source in front of you (behind camera)
- Even illumination
- Not harsh/squint-inducing
- Window light to side is often good

### What to Avoid

- Backlit (window behind you) - makes you lean forward
- Overhead only (shadows) - may hunch or tilt
- Too dim (strain)

---

## Multi-Hour Call Days

### Survival Strategies

**Schedule breaks:**
- 5-10 minutes between calls
- Use for movement, not email
- Step away from desk completely

**Standing calls:**
- Stand for some calls if setup allows
- Even pacing helps
- Use for calls where you're mostly listening

**Audio-only when possible:**
- Give yourself permission
- Allows movement
- Reduces screen time

**Walking meetings:**
- Phone/audio calls on walk
- Headphones or earbuds
- Great for 1:1s without screen-sharing

### Physical Maintenance

**Before call-heavy days:**
- Morning stretching routine
- Good night's sleep
- Healthy breakfast (energy for engagement)

**After call-heavy days:**
- Extended stretching
- Eye rest (no more screens)
- Movement (walk, exercise)

## Equipment That Helps

### Essentials

- External webcam at eye level
- Monitor at proper height
- Good chair with support
- Quality headphones (allow movement)

### Nice to Have

- Ring light or quality lighting
- Standing desk for variety
- Multiple monitors (reduce tab switching)
- Comfortable background (psychological ease)

---

## Quick Posture Check

**Before important calls:**

1. [ ] Camera at eye level
2. [ ] Sitting back in chair
3. [ ] Shoulders down and relaxed
4. [ ] Spine tall but not rigid
5. [ ] Feet flat on floor
6. [ ] Arms relaxed
7. [ ] Face neutral, not tense

**During calls (check every 10-15 min):**

1. [ ] Still sitting back? (not leaning)
2. [ ] Shoulders relaxed?
3. [ ] Jaw unclenched?
4. [ ] Breathing normally?

## Common Scenarios

### Laptop on Lap (Couch)

**Problems:** Looking down, spine curved, no support
**Solutions:** Don't do this for work calls. Move to desk setup.

### Kitchen Table

**Problems:** Often too high, wrong chair
**Solutions:** Laptop stand to raise camera, cushion for chair, limit time

### Bed as Office

**Problems:** Everything
**Solutions:** Don't. Have a designated work space for calls.

### Coffee Shop

**Problems:** No control over setup
**Solutions:** Brief calls only, awareness of posture, stretch after
