# Baby Carrying Posture Guide

> **Carrying a Growing Human:** Babies start at 7-9 pounds and triple their weight in a year. You'll carry them for hours daily. Your posture setup matters enormously.

---

## The Fundamentals

### Basic Principles

1. **Weight close to body** - Center of gravity matters
2. **Supported spine** - Yours and baby's
3. **Even weight distribution** - Avoid one-sided carrying
4. **Frequent position changes** - No single position is perfect forever
5. **Proper equipment fit** - Carriers must be adjusted correctly

---

## Carrying In Arms

### The Hip Carry

**Most common—and most problematic:**

- Hip shifts out to create "seat"
- Spine curves to compensate
- One-sided, repetitive strain
- Hard on hip, back, and shoulder

**If you must hip carry:**
- Switch sides frequently (every 5-10 minutes)
- Engage core to support spine
- Keep baby as close as possible
- Minimize duration

### The Cradle Hold

**Newborn position:**

- Both arms supporting baby
- Baby across front of body
- Weight distributed to both arms
- Sit whenever possible

**Posture tips:**
- Don't hunch over baby
- Support arms on pillows when sitting
- Relax shoulders down
- Use support when possible

### The Upright Hold

**Baby on shoulder/chest:**

- One hand under bottom
- Other hand on back
- Baby's weight against your chest
- Switch sides regularly

**Posture tips:**
- Stand tall—don't lean back
- Core engaged
- Avoid shoulder shrugging
- Baby close to your center

## Baby Carriers

### Types Overview

**Soft structured carriers (SSC):**
- Buckles and structured waist/shoulder straps
- Easy to use once adjusted
- Good weight distribution
- Examples: Ergobaby, Lillebaby, Tula

**Wraps:**
- Fabric you tie/wrap around body
- Learning curve to use
- Very close carrying
- Good for newborns

**Ring slings:**
- Fabric with rings for adjustment
- One-shoulder carry
- Quick on/off
- Good for short periods

**Meh dais (mei tais):**
- Hybrid of wrap and structured
- Ties at waist and shoulders
- Adjustable fit

### Proper Carrier Fit

**Waist belt:**
- Sits AT waist (not on hips)
- Snug but comfortable
- Takes majority of weight
- Level, not tilted

**Shoulder straps:**
- Evenly adjusted
- Not digging into neck
- Not slipping off shoulders
- Tight enough to hold baby close

**Baby position:**
- Close enough to kiss
- High on your chest
- Visible and clear airway
- Supported spine
- Knees higher than bum (M-position for hips)

### Front Carry

**Good for:**
- Newborns and young babies
- When baby wants to see you
- Breastfeeding in carrier

**Posture checks:**
- [ ] Standing tall, not leaning back
- [ ] Shoulders relaxed
- [ ] Core engaged
- [ ] Baby close and high
- [ ] Weight in waist belt

### Back Carry

**Good for:**
- Older babies with head control
- Longer carrying periods
- When you need to see/do things

**Posture checks:**
- [ ] Baby centered on back
- [ ] Shoulder straps even
- [ ] Not compensating with lean
- [ ] Core engaged
- [ ] Comfortable for extended wear

### Hip Carry (in carrier)

**Better than arms alone because:**
- Weight distributed to waist belt
- Some shoulder strap support
- Less spinal compensation

**Still watch for:**
- One-sided strain
- Leaning away from baby
- Duration limits

---

## Ring Slings and One-Shoulder Carriers

### The Challenge

- All weight on one shoulder
- Body compensates with curve/tilt
- Should be limited duration

### Best Practices

- Switch shoulders each use
- Limit to 20-30 minutes at a time
- Use for quick carries, not extended wear
- Ensure good sling technique
- Keep baby high and close

---

## Wraps

### Benefits for Posture

- When tied correctly, distribute weight well
- Very close carrying
- Adjustable support

### Challenges

- Learning curve to tie correctly
- Loose ties = poor support
- Can be hot

### Key Points

- Front wrap cross carry (FWCC) is common starting wrap
- Baby should be high on chest
- Fabric spread across shoulders and back
- Practice with a doll first

---

## Common Problems

### Lower Back Pain

**Causes:**
- Leaning back to compensate for front weight
- Waist belt too low
- Core not engaged
- Carrying too long

**Solutions:**
- Tighten waist belt at actual waist
- Engage core

- Take breaks
- Back carry for longer periods

### Shoulder/Neck Pain

**Causes:**
- Straps too narrow/digging in
- Straps too far out (falling off shoulders)

**Solutions:**

- Cross straps on back if option
- Switch sides regularly
- Trust baby is okay without looking

### Hip Pain

**Causes:**
- Hip carrying without support

- Asymmetric weight bearing

**Solutions:**

## As Baby Grows

### Newborn (0-3 months)

- Front carry facing you
- Close and high
- Frequent feeding may limit carrier time

### 3-6 months
- Heavier, better head control
- Still front carry
- Can start introducing back carry with some carriers
- Weight becoming more significant

### 6-12 months
- Back carry becomes easier
- Weight significant (15-22 lbs)
- Baby may have preferences
- Posture maintenance crucial

### Toddler (12+ months)
- Back carry preferred for weight
- Carrier for naps/long walks
- Independent walking reduces carry time
- Still heavy for extended carrying

---

## Car Seat Carrying

### The Problem

- Heavy, awkward load
- One-sided
- Extended arm position
- Terrible for posture

### Solutions

- Carry with two hands when possible
