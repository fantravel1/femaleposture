# Housework Posture Guide

> **The Hidden Workout:** Housework involves bending, lifting, reaching, and repetitive motions—often for hours. Without good technique, cleaning your home can hurt your body.

---

## General Principles

### Body Mechanics Basics

1. **Bend at hips, not back** - Hinge like a deadlift
2. **Keep loads close** - Don't reach and twist
3. **Use legs for lifting** - Not back
4. **Switch sides** - Avoid one-sided work
5. **Take breaks** - Don't power through

### Tools Matter

- Properly sized handles
- Tools in good condition
- Ergonomic designs when possible
- Right tool for the job

---

## Vacuuming and Mopping

### The Problems

- Forward bending
- Repetitive pushing/pulling
- One-sided motion
- Reaching under furniture

### Better Technique

**Vacuuming:**
1. Stand upright (don't hunch over)
2. Keep vacuum close to body
3. Use a lunge stance (one foot forward)
4. Move with your feet, not just arms
5. Switch leading hand/foot regularly

**Mopping:**
1. Hold mop at proper height (not too short)
2. Use whole body to move mop
3. Figure-eight motion (less repetitive)
4. Step into strokes
5. Switch hands periodically

### Equipment Tips

- Lightweight vacuum if possible
- Proper handle length (many extend)
- Swivel heads reduce reaching
- Consider cordless for mobility
- Mop handles at proper height

## Laundry

### The Problems

- Bending into machines
- Carrying heavy baskets
- Sorting on floor
- Repetitive folding

### Loading/Unloading Machines

**Front-loader:**
- Squat or kneel to reach in
- Don't bend and twist
- Support yourself with one hand

**Top-loader:**
- Use a stool if needed to reach
- Don't lean over edge excessively
- Take items out in batches

**Lifting basket:**
- Squat to lift
- Hold close to body
- Don't carry too heavy
- Multiple trips are fine

### Sorting and Folding

**Avoid floor sorting:**
- Use table or elevated surface
- Bed height works
- Reduces bending

**Folding:**
- Stand at waist-high surface
- Sit if standing is tiring
- Take breaks

### Hanging Clothes

**Reach carefully:**
- Use step stool for high rods
- Don't strain overhead
- Lower rod if possible
- Install at reachable height if able

## Dishes and Kitchen Cleaning

### At the Sink

**Height matters:**
- If sink is too low: wide stance lowers you
- If sink is too high: use stool
- Stand on anti-fatigue mat

**Position:**
- Hips close to counter
- Don't lean forward excessively
- Shift weight between feet
- Take sitting breaks if long session

### Counter Wiping

- Don't reach across too far
- Move around the counter
- Circular motions vary strain
- Switch hands

### Floor Mopping (Kitchen)

- Same principles as general mopping
- Kneel for detailed scrubbing
- Use long-handled tools for standing
- Don't do it all at once

---

## Bathroom Cleaning

### Toilet Cleaning

- Kneel rather than bend over
- Use long-handled brush when possible
- Knee pad helpful
- Don't contort to reach behind

### Tub/Shower Scrubbing

**From outside tub:**
- Don't lean over the edge
- Use long-handled scrubbers
- Kneel with support
- Break into sections

**From inside tub (if safe):**
- Non-slip mat essential
- Better positioning
- Still use long handles for reach

### Mirrors and Counters

- Stand close
- Work at eye level for upper areas
- Step stool if needed
- Switch hands

---

## General Cleaning

### Dusting High Surfaces

- Use extension dusters
- Step stool or ladder (safely)
- Don't stand on furniture
- Lower arms frequently

### Under Furniture

- Move furniture if possible (properly)
- Use tools with flexible heads
- Don't contort to reach
- Consider robot vacuum for daily

### Windows

**Lower windows:**
- Stand close
- Circular motions vary pattern
- Switch arms

**Higher windows:**
- Stable step stool
- Extension pole tools
- Don't overreach
- Break into sessions

---

## Lifting and Moving

### Carrying Cleaning Supplies

- Bucket with handle: carry at side, switch hands
- Spray bottles: organize in caddy
- Don't overload
- Use rolling cart if lots of supplies

### Moving Furniture

**If you must:**
- Get help for heavy items
- Push rather than pull
- Keep close to furniture
- Bend at hips, not back
- Use sliders when possible

**Better options:**
- Wait for help
- Furniture sliders
- Moving straps (distribute weight)
- Professional movers for heavy items

---

## Making Beds

### The Problems

- Reaching across bed
- Lifting mattress
- Bending forward
- Repetitive tucking

### Better Technique

1. Work from each side (don't reach across)
2. Kneel to tuck bottom sheets
3. Walk around, don't stretch
4. Lift mattress corner with legs, not back
5. Use fitted sheets to reduce tucking

---

## Seasonal Deep Cleaning

### Pacing

- Don't do everything in one day
- Spread across multiple sessions
- Rotate heavy and light tasks
- Listen to your body

### Recovery

- Stretch after cleaning sessions
- Apply heat or ice if sore
- Rest between intensive tasks
- It's okay to hire help for deep cleans

---

## Organization Reduces Strain

### Frequently Used Items

- At reachable heights
- Not too high or too low
- Heavy items at waist level
- Step stool for upper shelves

### Cleaning Supply Storage

- Easy access
- Not requiring reaching/bending
- Organized and ready
- Well-lit so you can see

---

## When to Get Help

### Hire Help If

- Chronic pain worsens with housework
- Physically unable to do tasks safely
- Large jobs that require heavy lifting
- Deep cleans that would hurt you

### Divide Tasks If

- Living with others
- Some tasks are harder for you
- Trade based on abilities
