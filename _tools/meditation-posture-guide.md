# Meditation Posture Guide

> **Comfort Allows Focus:** If you're thinking about your aching back or numb legs, you're not meditating. Good posture supports practice—it doesn't have to be fancy or "correct" looking.

---

## The Goal

### What Matters

- **Alert but relaxed** - Not rigid, not collapsed
- **Sustainable** - Maintainable for your session length
- **Supported** - Spine can be upright without strain
- **Comfortable enough** - Pain distracts from practice

### What Doesn't Matter

- Looking like a yoga teacher
- Sitting in full lotus
- Having no props
- Sitting perfectly still

---

## Basic Alignment Principles

### Spine

- Natural curves maintained
- Tall through crown of head
- Not rigidly straight
- Not collapsed/slouched

### Pelvis

- Slightly tilted forward (anterior tilt)
- Creates natural low back curve
- Allows spine to stack easily
- Hips higher than knees usually helps

### Shoulders

- Relaxed down and back
- Not rolled forward
- Not pulled back rigidly
- Natural resting position

### Head

- Balanced on top of spine
- Chin slightly tucked
- Ears over shoulders
- Jaw relaxed

### Hands

- Rest in lap
- On knees or thighs
- Any comfortable position
- Not holding tension

---

## Seated Positions

### Cross-Legged on Floor

**Basic cross-legged (Easy Pose):**
- Ankles crossed, not stacked
- Knees lower than hips (use cushion!)
- Hands on knees or in lap

**What helps:**
- Cushion under sit bones (essential for most)
- Blankets under knees for support
- Wall behind for back support if needed

**Challenges:**
- Hip tightness (modify with props)
- Knee discomfort (try different position)
- Falls asleep (legs)

### Kneeling

**Hero Pose variation:**
- Knees together on floor
- Sitting on cushion between feet
- Or on meditation bench

**What helps:**
- Bench or high cushion
- Blanket under knees and shins
- Padding for ankles

**Good for:**
- Those with hip tightness
- People who find cross-legged painful
- Keeps spine naturally upright

### Chair Sitting

**Perfectly valid for meditation:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Sitting away from back (or supported)
- Upright but relaxed

**What helps:**
- Firm chair (not too soft)
- Cushion for lumbar support
- Footrest if needed

**Good for:**
- Beginners
- Those with knee/hip issues
- Longer sessions
- Any body type

### Lying Down

**Savasana position:**
- On back
- Legs straight or bent
- Arms at sides

**Caution:** Easy to fall asleep

**Good for:**
- Those who can't sit
- Pain that prevents sitting
- Body scan meditations
- Yoga nidra
