# 10-Minute Evening Stretch Routine

> **Why Evening Stretching Helps:** Your body accumulates tension throughout the day. Tight hip flexors from sitting, tense shoulders from stress, compressed spine from gravity. This routine releases that tension, prepares your body for sleep, and helps prevent posture problems from becoming chronic.

- Mat or soft surface
- Pillow (optional)

**Best timing:**
- 30+ minutes before bed
- After changing into comfortable clothes
- Away from screens if possible

**Mindset:**
- This is unwinding, not exercise
- Slow, gentle movements
- Focus on breathing and releasing

## The 10-Minute Routine

### 1. Seated Neck Releases (1 minute)

*Sitting comfortably on floor or chair*

**Side stretch:**
1. Drop right ear toward right shoulder
2. Feel stretch on left side of neck
3. For more, gently press head with right hand
4. Hold 20 seconds
5. Repeat left side

**Chin to chest:**
1. Drop chin toward chest
2. Clasp hands behind head
3. Let arm weight gently deepen stretch
4. Hold 20 seconds

### 2. Shoulder and Chest Opening (1 minute)

*Still seated*

**Shoulder rolls:**

**Chest opener:**
1. Interlace fingers behind back

### 3. Seated Twist (2 minutes)

2. Place right hand behind you for support
3. Hug left arm around right knee or place elbow outside knee
4. Inhale, sit tall
5. Exhale, twist gently to the right

7. Switch sides

**What this does:** Restores thoracic rotation; releases mid-back and obliques.

2. **COW:** Inhale, drop belly, lift chest and tailbone

4. Sink hips forward and down
5. Feel stretch in front of left hip
6. Hold 1 minute
7. Switch sides—1 minute

   - Exhale through mouth, counting to 6

## Common Questions

### Should I do this every night?

Ideally, yes. But even 3-4 times per week helps. The more consistent, the better the results.

### Can I do this in bed?

Some stretches work in bed, but the floor or mat gives better support for full range of motion.

### What if I fall asleep during the routine?

That's fine—means it's working for relaxation! But try to complete the routine and then go to proper bed for better sleep quality.

### Is this stretching or exercise?

This is stretching and gentle mobility—not exercise. It complements your workout routine but doesn't replace it.

### Can I add to this routine?

Yes! If you have more time, hold stretches longer or add:
- Legs up the wall (great for circulation)
- Additional hip stretches
- Self-massage with ball or roller
