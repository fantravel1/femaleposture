# Travel Posture Routine: Stay Comfortable on Long Trips

> **The Challenge:** Long flights, car rides, and days in transit are rough on your body. This routine helps you arrive feeling better than you normally would.

---

## Why Travel Is Hard on Posture

During travel:
- You're stuck in cramped positions
- Movement is limited
- Seats aren't designed for your body
- Hours pass in the same position
- Stress adds muscle tension

The result: stiffness, pain, and posture that suffers for days after.

## Before You Travel

### The Night Before

1. Hip flexor stretch: 1 minute each side
2. Hamstring stretch: 1 minute each side

Going into travel with loose muscles helps you tolerate cramped positions better.
