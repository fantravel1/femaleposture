# Mirror Posture Check: What to Look For

> **Why Mirror Checks Help:** We can't see our own posture without a mirror or photo. Regular mirror checks build awareness and help you track improvement over time.

---

## What You Need

- Full-length mirror (or large enough to see your whole body)
- Comfortable, fitted clothing (easier to see body position)
- Time to observe without rushing

---

## Front View Assessment

Stand facing the mirror naturally. Don't "pose" or correct—just stand as you normally would.

### Head Position

**Ideal:** Head centered, not tilted to either side

**Issues to look for:**
- Head tilted left or right
- Chin jutting forward
- Head rotated (one ear more visible than other)

---

### Shoulders

**Ideal:** Level and equal height; not rolled forward

**Issues to look for:**
- One shoulder higher than the other
- Both shoulders rolled forward (hands visible in front of thighs)
- Shoulders elevated toward ears

**Quick test:** Where do your thumbs point?
- Thumbs forward or at sides = Good
- Thumbs turned in toward each other = Rounded shoulders

---

### Arms

**Ideal:** Hanging equally at sides; space between arms and body is equal

**Issues to look for:**
- One arm hanging further forward
- Unequal space between arm and body on each side
- One arm appearing longer (indicates side shift)

---

### Hips/Pelvis

**Ideal:** Level, hip bones at same height

**Issues to look for:**
- One hip higher than the other
- Hips shifted to one side
- One side appearing more prominent

**Quick test:** Place hands on hip bones. Are they level?

---

### Knees

**Ideal:** Pointing straight ahead, equal alignment

**Issues to look for:**
- Knees pointing inward (knock-kneed)
- Knees pointing outward (bow-legged)
- One knee more bent than the other

---

### Feet

**Ideal:** Pointing slightly outward (about 10-15 degrees); equal weight distribution

**Issues to look for:**
- One foot turned out more
- Arches collapsed (flat feet)
- Weight clearly on one side

---

## Side View Assessment

Turn sideways to the mirror. You may need to turn your head to see, or use a phone camera on timer.

### Ideal Alignment

When viewed from the side, a plumb line should pass through:
1. Ear
2. Shoulder (middle)
3. Hip (side of pelvis)
4. Knee (slightly in front of center)
5. Ankle (slightly in front of ankle bone)

---

### Head Position

**Ideal:** Ear aligns with shoulder

**Forward head posture:** Ear is in front of shoulder line
- Common sign: You can see your neck from the side view
- Often accompanied by chin jutting forward

---

### Shoulder Position

**Ideal:** Middle of shoulder aligns with ear and hip

**Rounded shoulders:** Shoulders sit forward of the hip line
- Common sign: Upper back appears rounded
- Chest may appear sunken

---

### Upper Back (Thoracic Spine)

**Ideal:** Gentle natural curve (kyphosis)

**Excessive curve (hyperkyphosis):**
- Hump-like appearance at upper back
- Shoulders round forward
- Often called "dowager's hump" when pronounced

**Flat upper back:**
- Upper back appears very straight
- Less common but can cause stiffness

---

### Lower Back (Lumbar Spine)

**Ideal:** Gentle inward curve (lordosis)

**Excessive curve (hyperlordosis):**
- Lower back arches significantly
- Belly may push forward
- Common in anterior pelvic tilt

**Flat lower back (hypolordosis):**
- Lower back appears straight or curves outward
- Common in posterior pelvic tilt

---

### Pelvis Position

**Ideal:** Level, not tilted forward or back

**Anterior pelvic tilt:**
- Belt line angles downward in front
- Lower back arches more
- Belly protrudes

**Posterior pelvic tilt:**
- Belt line angles upward in front
- Lower back flattens
- Tucked-under appearance

---

### Knee Position

**Ideal:** Slight softness, not locked

**Hyperextended knees:**
- Knees push backward
- Legs appear to curve back
- Common in women

---

## Common Patterns You Might See

### Pattern 1: Upper Crossed Syndrome

- Forward head
- Rounded shoulders
- Increased upper back curve
- Often: Tight chest, weak upper back

### Pattern 2: Lower Crossed Syndrome

- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Excessive lower back arch
- Hip flexors appear tight
- Belly protrudes

### Pattern 3: Swayback

- Head forward
- Upper back very rounded
- Pelvis pushed forward
- Appears to be leaning back

### Pattern 4: Flat Back

- Minimal curves in spine
- Pelvis tucked under
- Stiff appearance
- Can cause back pain

## Recording Your Findings

Create a simple checklist:

**Front View:**
- [ ] Head centered
- [ ] Shoulders level
- [ ] Shoulders not rolled forward
- [ ] Hips level
- [ ] Weight even on both feet

**Side View:**
- [ ] Ear over shoulder
- [ ] Shoulder over hip
- [ ] No excessive forward head
- [ ] Upper back curve normal
- [ ] Lower back curve normal
- [ ] Knees not hyperextended

---

## Tracking Progress

### Take Photos

- Same position, same clothing, same time of day
- Front and side views
- Compare monthly

### Regular Checks

- Quick daily mirror glance (builds awareness)
- Detailed check weekly
- Photo comparison monthly

### What to Look For

As you work on posture:
- Head coming back over shoulders
- Shoulders appearing less rounded
- More balanced appearance
- Standing taller

---

## Limitations of Mirror Checks

**What mirrors show:**
- Static standing posture
- Visible asymmetries
- General alignment

**What mirrors don't show:**
- How you move
- Your posture when you're not looking
- How you sit
- Internal issues

**Remember:** Posture is dynamic. How you hold yourself when not thinking about it matters most.

---

## When to Seek Professional Assessment

Consider seeing a professional if:
- Significant asymmetries that don't improve
- Pain accompanying posture issues
- Visible curvature of spine (scoliosis)
- Numbness, tingling, or weakness
- No improvement after consistent work

Professionals can perform detailed assessments and identify issues a mirror check may miss.
