# Bra Fitting for Better Posture

> **The Overlooked Factor:** Most women wear the wrong bra size. Poor fit affects posture, causes pain, and can contribute to shoulder and back problems. Proper support makes a real difference.

---

## How Bras Affect Posture

### With Proper Support

- Weight distributed evenly
- Shoulders don't carry breast weight
- Spine stays neutral
- Less upper back fatigue
- Reduced neck strain

### With Poor Support

- Shoulders pulled forward
- Upper back rounds
- Neck compensates
- Pain in shoulders, back, neck
- Strap grooves in shoulders

---

## Signs of Poor Bra Fit

### Band Issues

- [ ] Band rides up in back
- [ ] Band is too loose (can fit more than 2 fingers)
- [ ] Band is too tight (cutting in, painful)
- [ ] Band not level all the way around

### Cup Issues

- [ ] Spillage over cup tops
- [ ] Gaping cups
- [ ] Breast tissue escaping under cups
- [ ] Underwire sitting on breast tissue
- [ ] Center gore not flat against chest

### Strap Issues

- [ ] Straps digging into shoulders
- [ ] Straps falling down constantly
- [ ] Red marks or grooves after wearing

## Finding Your Size

### The Truth About Sizing

- Sizes vary widely between brands
- Most women are wearing wrong size
- Professional fitting helps
- Size changes with weight, age, pregnancy

### DIY Measurement

**Band size:**
1. Measure snugly around ribcage, under bust
2. If even number, that's your band size
3. If odd, round up (or try both)

**Bust size:**
1. Measure around fullest part of bust
2. Subtract band measurement
3. Each inch difference = cup size (1"=A, 2"=B, 3"=C, etc.)

**Example:**
- Ribcage: 34 inches (band size 34)
- Bust: 38 inches
- Difference: 4 inches = D cup
- Size: 34D

### Sister Sizing

Same cup volume, different band:
- 34D = 36C = 32DD
- If band is too tight, try up a band and down a cup
- If band is too loose, try down a band and up a cup

---

## Fitting a Bra

### The Band

**Should:**
- Sit level around body
- Be snug on loosest hooks (room to tighten)
- Stay in place without straps
- Fit 2 fingers underneath comfortably

**Provides:** 80-90% of support

### The Cups

**Should:**
- Contain all breast tissue
- Sit smooth without gaps or bulges
- Have center gore flat against sternum
- Have underwire encircle entire breast

### The Straps

**Should:**
- Fit without digging in
- Stay in place
- Not do heavy lifting (band's job)
- Be adjustable

## Bra Types for Posture

### Best for Support

**Full coverage:**

**Back-smoothing bras:**
- Wider bands
- More coverage
- Distributes pressure

**Wide-strap bras:**
- Reduces shoulder dig
- Better for larger busts
- More comfortable long-term

### "Posture Bras"

**Marketed features:**
- Criss-cross back straps
- Posture-encouraging design
- Back support claims

**Reality:**
- A well-fitting regular bra may work as well
- Support comes from proper fit
- May help with awareness/reminder
- Try before committing

### For Exercise

**Need:**
- Encapsulation for larger busts
- Reduced bounce (impacts posture)
- Firm but comfortable fit
- Breathable material

## Larger Bust Considerations

### Extra Challenges

If experiencing:

Discuss with healthcare provider.
