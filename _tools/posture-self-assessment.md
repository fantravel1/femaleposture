# Complete Posture Self-Assessment

> **Why Assess Your Posture:** Before you can improve your posture, you need to know where you're starting. This comprehensive self-assessment helps you identify specific areas that need attention so you can focus your efforts effectively.

---

## What You'll Need

- A full-length mirror (or camera/phone)
- A wall
- A friend to help (optional but helpful)
- 10-15 minutes
- Comfortable clothing you can see your body shape in

---

## The Wall Test: Starting Point

Stand with your back against a wall:

1. Heels about 3 inches from wall
2. Buttocks touching wall
3. Shoulder blades touching wall
4. Back of head touching wall (without tilting chin up)

### What to Notice

**Lower back:**
- [ ] Can you slide your hand between lower back and wall?
- [ ] Is it more than one hand thickness?
- [ ] Is it less than one hand thickness (or no space)?

**Shoulders:**
- [ ] Do both shoulder blades touch the wall easily?
- [ ] Do you have to force them back?
- [ ] Does one touch more easily than the other?

**Head:**
- [ ] Does the back of your head naturally touch the wall?
- [ ] Do you have to tilt your chin up to touch?
- [ ] Does your head not touch at all?

### Interpreting Results

| Finding | What It May Indicate |
|---------|---------------------|
| Large lower back gap | Anterior pelvic tilt |
| Minimal lower back gap | Posterior pelvic tilt or flat back |
| Shoulders won't touch | Rounded shoulders |
| Head won't touch | Forward head posture |
| One side different | Asymmetry to address |

---

## Head and Neck Assessment

### Forward Head Check

**Side view (mirror or photo):**

Look at where your ear is relative to your shoulder.

- [ ] **Ear over shoulder:** Good alignment
- [ ] **Ear forward of shoulder:** Forward head posture
- [ ] **Ear far forward of shoulder:** Significant forward head

**Measure:** Have someone take a side photo. The ear should be roughly over the middle of the shoulder.

### Chin Position

Standing naturally, notice your chin:

- [ ] **Level chin:** Good
- [ ] **Chin tilted up:** Compensating for forward head
- [ ] **Chin tucked excessively:** Overcorrection

### Neck Mobility Test

**Rotation:**
1. Look straight ahead
2. Turn head to right as far as comfortable
3. Note: Can you get chin over shoulder?
4. Repeat left
5. Compare sides

**Flexion/Extension:**
1. Tuck chin to chest (how close?)
2. Look up at ceiling (comfortable range?)

**What to notice:**
- Significant asymmetry between sides
- Pain or restriction
- Compensating by moving shoulders

---

## Shoulder Assessment

### Rounded Shoulder Check

**From the side:**
- [ ] Can you see your back behind your shoulders?
- [ ] Are your shoulders visibly forward?
- [ ] Do your palms face backward when arms hang?

**The Palm Test:**
Stand naturally, arms at sides. Look at your hands:
- [ ] **Thumbs forward:** Good shoulder position
- [ ] **Palms facing back:** Indicates internal rotation/rounded shoulders

### Shoulder Height Check

**From the front:**
- [ ] Are your shoulders level?
- [ ] Is one higher than the other?
- [ ] Note which side is higher

Common: Dominant side often higher due to muscle development or carrying habits.

### Shoulder Blade Position

Have someone look at your back, or use a photo:

- [ ] Are shoulder blades flat against rib cage?
- [ ] Do they "wing out" (inner edges lifting)?
- [ ] Is one more prominent than the other?

---

## Spine Assessment

### Side View Curves

Looking from the side (photo helps):

**Cervical spine (neck):**
- Should have gentle forward curve

**Thoracic spine (upper/mid back):**
- Should have gentle backward curve
- [ ] Is the curve excessive? (Kyphosis)
- [ ] Is it flattened?

**Lumbar spine (lower back):**
- Should have gentle forward curve
- [ ] Is the curve excessive? (Lordosis)
- [ ] Is it flattened?

### Scoliosis Screen

Have someone look at your back while you bend forward:

1. Stand with feet together
2. Slowly bend forward, letting arms hang
3. Observer looks for asymmetry in rib cage or lower back

**Note:** One side significantly higher than other may indicate scoliosis. This warrants professional evaluation.

---

## Pelvis Assessment

### Anterior/Posterior Tilt Check

**Side view:**

Find these landmarks:
- ASIS (front hip bones - the bony points at front of pelvis)
- PSIS (back dimples - bony points at back of pelvis)

Ideally, ASIS should be level with or slightly below PSIS.

- [ ] **ASIS significantly lower than PSIS:** Anterior pelvic tilt
- [ ] **ASIS higher than PSIS:** Posterior pelvic tilt
- [ ] **Roughly level:** Neutral pelvis

**Simplified check:**
Look at your belt line from the side:
- [ ] Belt dips down in front: Anterior tilt
- [ ] Belt dips down in back: Posterior tilt
- [ ] Belt relatively level: Neutral

### Lateral Tilt Check

**From the front:**
- [ ] Is your pelvis level?
- [ ] Does one hip appear higher?
- [ ] Note which side

Often related to leg length differences (true or functional) or muscle imbalances.

---

## Hip and Leg Assessment

### Hip Mobility Check

**Thomas Test (Hip Flexor Tightness):**

1. Sit at edge of table or firm bed
2. Lie back, pulling one knee to chest
3. Let other leg hang off edge
4. Observe hanging leg:

- [ ] Thigh drops to table level: Good hip flexor length
- [ ] Thigh stays elevated: Tight hip flexors
- [ ] Knee straightens out: Tight rectus femoris

Repeat other side and compare.

### Leg Length Check

Lie on your back:
1. Have someone look at your feet
2. Are the ankle bones level?
3. Check if one leg appears longer

**Note:** Apparent leg length difference can be structural or from muscle imbalances. Significant differences warrant professional evaluation.

### Knee Position

**From the front:**
- [ ] Do knees point straight ahead?
- [ ] Do knees turn inward (valgus/knock-kneed)?
- [ ] Do knees turn outward (varus/bow-legged)?

---

## Foot Assessment

### Arch Check

**Wet footprint test:**
1. Wet the bottom of your foot
2. Step on dark paper or surface that shows print
3. Observe the footprint

- [ ] **Normal arch:** About half of the arch area shows
- [ ] **Flat feet:** Most or all of foot shows
- [ ] **High arch:** Very little of arch shows

### Foot Position

Standing naturally, look at your feet:

- [ ] Do feet point straight ahead?
- [ ] Do feet turn out (duck feet)?
- [ ] Do feet turn in (pigeon toed)?
- [ ] Is one foot different from the other?

---

## Dynamic Assessment: How You Move

Posture isn't just about standing still. How you move matters too.

### Walking Observation

Have someone watch you walk (or video yourself):

- [ ] Do your arms swing evenly?
- [ ] Does your torso stay upright?
- [ ] Do your feet point straight ahead?
- [ ] Is your stride even on both sides?

### Squat Test

Perform a bodyweight squat:

1. Feet shoulder-width apart
2. Squat as deep as comfortable
3. Have someone observe from front and side

**From the side:**
- [ ] Can you keep your torso relatively upright?
- [ ] Does your lower back round at the bottom?
- [ ] Do your heels stay down?

**From the front:**
- [ ] Do your knees track over your toes?
- [ ] Do your knees cave inward?
- [ ] Do you shift to one side?

---

## Tracking Your Progress

Repeat this assessment:
