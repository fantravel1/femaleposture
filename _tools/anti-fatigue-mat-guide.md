### Material

**Polyurethane:**
- Common choice
- Durable
- Good cushion
- Moderate price

**Gel:**
- Extra cushion
- Can be squishy

- Often more expensive

**Rubber:**
- Very durable
- Good for industrial
- Heavier
- May have odor initially

**Foam:**
- Lighter weight
- May compress over time
- More affordable
- Good for light use

### Size

**Standing desk:**
- At least 24" x 36"
- Should fit your stance width
- Room to shift positions
- Not hanging off edge

**Kitchen:**
- Long runners available
- Cover main standing area
- Consider multiple mats

### Features

**Beveled edges:**
- Prevent tripping
- Essential for walkways
- Look for all sides beveled

**Texture:**
- Some grip is good

## Using Your Mat Effectively

### Positioning

- Center under where you stand
- Not too close to desk edge
- Room to move
- Easy to step on/off

### Still Move!

Even with a mat:
- Shift weight regularly
- Take walking breaks
- Don't stand frozen
- Mat enables, not replaces, movement

### Footwear

- Supportive shoes still help
- Barefoot is okay on mat
- Avoid high heels on mat (instability)
- Whatever is comfortable

---

## Maintenance

### Cleaning

- Wipe with damp cloth
- Mild soap if needed
- Dry completely
- Check manufacturer instructions

### Longevity

- Quality mats last 3-5+ years
- Replace when compressed
- Edges curling = replace
- Losing cushion = replace

### Rotation

- Rotate 180° periodically
- Prevents uneven wear
- Extends life
- Especially if you favor one spot

---

## Common Issues

### Mat Moves Around

**Solutions:**
- Mat with non-slip bottom
- Anti-slip pad underneath
- Choose appropriate for your floor type
- Heavier mat may stay put better

### Too Soft/Squishy

**Causes:**
- Gel mat may feel too unstable
- Thick mat may be too much
- Try thinner or firmer option
- Some people prefer firmer feel

### Not Helping

**Consider:**
- Is mat thick enough?
- Are you still standing too long?
- Footwear issue?
- May need other interventions too

---

## Budget Considerations

### Budget ($30-50)

- Basic foam/polyurethane
- Adequate for light use
- May compress faster
- Good starting point

### Mid-Range ($50-100)

- Better materials
- Longer lasting
- Good features (beveled edges)
- Worth it for daily use

### Premium ($100+)

- Top materials
- Active features
- Warranties
- Best for heavy use

### Cost-Per-Day

If you use it 250 days/year for 3 years:
- $50 mat = ~7 cents/day
- $100 mat = ~13 cents/day

Worth the investment for comfort!
