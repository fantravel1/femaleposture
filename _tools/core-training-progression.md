# Core Training Progression

> **Core Is More Than Abs:** Your core includes muscles all around your torso—front, sides, and back. Strong core supports spine, improves posture, and reduces pain. Here's how to build it progressively.

---

## What Is "Core"?

### The Core Muscles

**Front:**
- Rectus abdominis (the "six-pack")
- Transverse abdominis (deep stabilizer)

**Sides:**
- Internal and external obliques
- Quadratus lumborum

**Back:**
- Erector spinae
- Multifidus

**Bottom:**
- Pelvic floor muscles
- Hip flexors

### Why It Matters for Posture

- Supports spine from all directions
- Allows upright posture without fatigue
- Protects back during movement
- Connects upper and lower body

---

## Before You Start

### Foundational Skills

**Breathing:**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Place hands on lower ribs
3. Breathe in—feel ribs expand sideways
4. Breathe out—feel ribs come in
5. Practice until natural

**Core Engagement (Bracing):**
1. Lie on back
2. Breathe normally
3. Gently draw belly button toward spine
4. As if preparing for a punch to stomach
5. Maintain while breathing
6. Should be 20-30% effort, not maximum

### Assessment

**Can you:**
- [ ] Breathe while engaging core?
- [ ] Hold engagement for 10 seconds?
- [ ] Maintain neutral spine?

If no, work on these before progressing.

## Common Mistakes

### During Exercises

- **Holding breath** - Keep breathing!
- **Arching back** in dead bugs/planks
- **Sagging hips** in planks
- **Rushing** - Slow and controlled
- **Using momentum** instead of muscles

### In Programming

- **Skipping phases** - Build foundation first
- **Too much too soon** - Progress gradually
- **Ignoring pain** - Stop if it hurts
- **Only training "abs"** - Full core includes back

---

## Modifications

### If Planks Are Too Hard

- Incline plank (hands on bench)
- Knee plank
- Wall plank
- Shorter holds

### If Back Hurts

- Check form (neutral spine)
- Reduce range of motion
- Choose easier variation
- See provider if persistent

### For Pregnancy

- No supine exercises after first trimester
- Modified planks
- Watch for diastasis
- See [Pregnant Athletes Guide](/populations/pregnant-athletes/)

### For Postpartum

- Start with Phase 1 (even if you were advanced)
- Get pelvic floor checked
- Watch for diastasis recti
- Progress gradually
