# Pelvic Floor Basics

> **The Hidden Foundation:** Your pelvic floor is the base of your core. It supports your organs, affects your posture, and plays a role in bladder and bowel control. Every woman should understand this often-overlooked muscle group.

---

## What Is the Pelvic Floor?

### Anatomy

A group of muscles that:
- Stretch like a hammock from pubic bone to tailbone
- Support bladder, uterus, and rectum
- Help control bladder and bowel
- Play a role in sexual function
- Work with core for spine support

### Connection to Posture

Your pelvic floor:
- Forms the base of your core "canister"
- Works with deep abdominals
- Coordinates with diaphragm (breathing)
- Affects hip and spine position
- Influences overall stability

---

## Why It Matters

### Pelvic Floor Health Affects

- Bladder control
- Bowel control
- Core stability
- Sexual function
- Pregnancy and birth
- Postpartum recovery
- Posture and back health
- Athletic performance

### Common Issues

**Too weak:**
- Leaking urine (stress incontinence)
- Pelvic organ prolapse
- Poor core stability
- Difficulty during sex

**Too tight:**
- Pelvic pain
- Painful sex
- Urinary urgency
- Difficulty emptying bladder/bowel

---

## Self-Assessment

### Can You Identify the Muscles?

**Try this:**
1. Imagine stopping urination mid-stream
2. Or holding in gas
3. Those are pelvic floor muscles
4. (Don't actually stop urination regularly—can cause issues)

### Signs of Weakness

- Leaking when coughing, sneezing, jumping
- Feeling of heaviness in pelvis
- Difficulty controlling gas
- Needing to urinate very frequently

### Signs of Tightness

- Pelvic pain
- Pain with insertion (tampon, sex)
- Difficulty fully emptying bladder
- Constipation without other cause

---

## Basic Exercises

### Kegels (When Appropriate)

**Note:** Kegels are not for everyone. If you have a tight pelvic floor, strengthening isn't the goal—see a pelvic floor PT.

**How to do a Kegel:**
1. Empty bladder first
2. Sit, stand, or lie comfortably
3. Contract pelvic floor (as if stopping urine/holding gas)
4. Lift and squeeze
5. Hold 3-5 seconds
6. Fully release for 3-5 seconds
7. Repeat 10 times
8. Do 3 sets daily

**Key points:**
- Don't hold breath
- Don't squeeze glutes or inner thighs
- Full release is as important as contraction
- Stop if you feel pain

### Quick Flicks

**For muscle responsiveness:**
1. Quick contract and release
2. 1 second each
3. 10 repetitions
4. Rest 10 seconds
5. Repeat 3 times

### The Knack

**For preventing leaks:**
1. Before coughing, sneezing, lifting
2. Quick pelvic floor contraction
3. Brace before the effort
4. Reduces stress on muscles

## Coordination with Core

### The Core Canister

Think of your core as a cylinder:
- Top: Diaphragm (breathing muscle)
- Front/sides: Abdominals
- Back: Spinal muscles
- Bottom: Pelvic floor

These all work together!

### Breathing Coordination

**On inhale:**
- Diaphragm descends
- Pelvic floor gently descends
- Belly expands

**On exhale:**
- Diaphragm rises
- Pelvic floor gently lifts
- Belly draws in

### Exercise Integration

- Exhale on effort (lifting, pushing)
- Pelvic floor naturally engages
- Don't bear down
- Coordinate breath with movement

---

## Life Stages and Pelvic Floor

### Teens/Young Adults

- Rarely discussed but can have issues
- Athletic women may have dysfunction
- Foundation for future health

### Pregnancy

- Extra weight on pelvic floor
- Hormones loosen muscles
- Important to maintain (not overwork)
- Prepare for birth

### Childbirth

- Significant stretch/trauma possible
- Recovery essential
- Assess postpartum
- PT if needed

### Postpartum

- Muscles need rehabilitation
- Start gentle, progress gradually
- May need professional guidance
- Full recovery takes months

### Perimenopause/Menopause

- Hormone changes affect muscles
- May weaken or change
- Continued exercise important
- May need different approach

### Senior Years

- Continued maintenance
- Balance strength and flexibility
- Incontinence not inevitable
- Can improve at any age

## When to See a Specialist

### Pelvic Floor Physical Therapist

**See a PT if:**
- Leaking urine regularly
- Feeling of prolapse
- Pelvic pain
- Pain during sex
- Difficulty emptying bladder/bowel
- After childbirth (recommended for all)
- Can't identify the muscles
- Not sure if you're doing exercises right

### What PT Involves

- Internal and/or external assessment
- Identification of dysfunction
- Customized exercise program
- Manual therapy if needed
- Education and tools

---

## Common Mistakes

### With Kegels

- Squeezing wrong muscles (glutes, abs)
- Holding breath
- Pushing down instead of lifting
- Not fully relaxing
- Doing when muscles are already tight

### With Expectations

- Expecting instant results
- Only doing when remembering
- Ignoring signs of dysfunction
- Assuming all problems need Kegels

---

## Daily Integration

### Reminders

- Link to daily activities
- Examples: Every red light, every phone check
- After using bathroom
- Before lifting heavy things

### Positions for Practice

**All positions work:**
- Lying down (easiest)
- Sitting
- Standing (most functional)
- During exercise

### Consistency

- Daily practice
- Takes weeks-months to see results
- Maintenance ongoing
- Like any other muscle training

---

## For Athletes

### Special Considerations

- High-impact sports stress pelvic floor
- Leaking during exercise is common but not normal
- Strong abs ≠ strong pelvic floor
- Breathing patterns matter

### Signs to Address

- Leaking during running, jumping, lifting
- Heaviness after exercise
- Need to urinate frequently during workout
- Any pelvic pain with exercise

---

## Quick Reference

### Basic Kegel Routine

| Exercise | Reps | Sets | Frequency |
|----------|------|------|-----------|
| Hold (3-5 sec) | 10 | 3 | Daily |
| Quick flicks | 10 | 3 | Daily |

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Breathe normally
- Fully release between contractions
- Be consistent
- Seek help if unsure

**Don't:**
- Hold breath
- Squeeze glutes/thighs
- Bear down
- Ignore pain
