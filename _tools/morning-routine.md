# 5-Minute Morning Posture Routine

> **Why Morning Matters:** How you start your day sets the tone for your posture. After hours of sleeping, your spine needs gentle movement, and your muscles need activation. This quick routine wakes up your body and prepares it to hold you upright all day.

---

## Before You Begin

**What you need:**
- 5 minutes
- Comfortable clothing
- Open floor space (optional mat)

**Best timing:**
- Right after waking
- Before checking phone
- Before or after bathroom, your choice

**Mindset:**
- This is for you
- Not intense exercise—gentle awakening
- Focus on how your body feels

## The 5-Minute Routine

### 1. Supine Body Wake-Up (30 seconds)

*Still lying in bed or on floor*

1. Lie on your back
2. Arms overhead, legs extended
3. Reach fingertips and toes in opposite directions
4. STRETCH—make yourself as long as possible
5. Hold for 5-10 seconds
6. Release and repeat 2-3 times

**What this does:** Lengthens spine after compressed sleep position; wakes up whole body.

---

### 2. Knees to Chest (30 seconds)

*Still lying down*

1. Hug both knees to chest
2. Gently rock side to side
3. Feel lower back massage against floor/mattress
4. Circle knees gently if it feels good
5. Release and repeat

**What this does:** Releases lower back tension; gentle spinal mobilization.

---

### 3. Supine Twist (1 minute)

*Still lying down*

1. Arms out to sides in T position
2. Knees bent, feet on floor
3. Let both knees drop to the right
4. Look toward left hand
5. Hold 30 seconds, breathing deeply
6. Bring knees through center
7. Drop knees to left, look right
8. Hold 30 seconds

**What this does:** Restores thoracic rotation; releases mid-back; stretches obliques.

---

### 4. Cat-Cow (1 minute)

*Come to hands and knees*

1. Hands under shoulders, knees under hips
2. **COW:** Inhale, drop belly, lift chest and tailbone, look up
3. **CAT:** Exhale, round spine, tuck chin, tuck tailbone
4. Flow slowly between positions
5. Let breath guide movement
6. 8-10 cycles

**What this does:** Mobilizes entire spine; coordinates breath with movement; wakes up core.

---

### 5. Child's Pose with Reach (30 seconds)

*From hands and knees*

1. Sit hips back toward heels
2. Arms extended forward, forehead toward floor
3. Walk hands to the right—feel left side stretch
4. Hold 10 seconds
5. Walk hands to center
6. Walk hands to the left—feel right side stretch
7. Hold 10 seconds
8. Return to center

**What this does:** Stretches back and sides; calms nervous system; gentle hip opening.

---

### 6. Chin Tucks (30 seconds)

*Come to standing or sitting*

1. Stand or sit tall
2. Look straight ahead
3. Gently draw chin straight back (making a "double chin")
4. Hold 5 seconds
5. Release
6. Repeat 5 times

**What this does:** Activates deep neck flexors; counters forward head position from sleeping.

---

### 7. Shoulder Rolls + Posture Set (30 seconds)

*Standing*

1. Roll shoulders up, back, and down—3 times
2. Roll shoulders up, forward, and down—3 times
3. Return to standing tall
4. Take a deep breath
5. Set your "posture intention" for the day

**What this does:** Releases shoulder tension; establishes good standing posture; mental preparation.

---

### 8. Forward Fold (30 seconds)

*Standing*

1. Feet hip-width apart
2. Fold forward from hips (knees can bend)
3. Let head hang heavy
4. Hold opposite elbows and sway gently
5. Slowly roll up to standing, head comes up last

**What this does:** Releases hamstrings and back; calms nervous system; completes the awakening.

## Modifications

- Listen to your body

### If You're Pregnant

- Skip lying on back after first trimester (do on side instead)
- Use pillow support as needed

Do just these:
1. Cat-Cow (1 min)
2. Supine Twist (1 min)
3. Chin Tucks + Shoulder Rolls (1 min)

### If You Have More Time (10 minutes)

## Tips for Consistency

### Make It Automatic

- Do it at the same time every day
- Before bathroom or right after
- Before you pick up your phone
- Connect it to an existing habit

### Remove Barriers

- Keep mat by bed (or do it in bed)
- Sleep in comfortable clothes
- Don't negotiate with yourself—just start

### Track It

- Simple checkbox on calendar
- Note how you feel on days you do it vs. skip
- Build a streak

---

## What You Should Feel After

**Positive signs:**
- More awake and alert
- Spine feels "taller"
- Muscles feel ready for the day
- Mind is calmer
- Ready to maintain good posture

**If you feel pain:**
- Reduce intensity or range of motion
- Skip problematic exercises
- Consult a professional if persistent

## Common Questions

### Can I do this in bed?

Yes! The first few exercises work on any surface. Come to the floor or standing for the last few.

### What if I miss a day?

Just do it the next day. Missing one day doesn't erase all benefit. Don't let missing one become missing many.

### Is this enough exercise?

This is a posture routine, not a workout. It's a great start to the day, but add other exercise (walking, strength training) for complete fitness.

### Can I do this at other times?

Absolutely. It works any time you need to reset your body. Great after travel, long sitting, or stressful days too.
