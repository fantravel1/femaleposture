# Flexibility Self-Assessment

> **Know Your Tight Spots:** Limited flexibility in key areas affects posture. These simple tests help you identify what needs attention.

---

## Before You Start

### How to Use This Assessment

- Do each test as described
- Note your results
- Compare to "typical" ranges
- Identify areas for improvement
- Reassess every 4-6 weeks

### Safety Notes

- Warm up lightly before testing
- Move slowly into positions
- Stop at discomfort, not pain
- Don't bounce or force
- Results are guide, not diagnosis

---

## Hip Flexor Test

### Thomas Test (Modified)

**How to do it:**
1. Sit at end of firm table or bench
2. Pull one knee to chest
3. Lie back, holding that knee
4. Let other leg hang off edge
5. Observe hanging leg position

**What you're looking at:**
- Does thigh lie flat or lift up?
- Does knee stay at 90° or straighten?

**Results:**
- **Normal:** Thigh lies on table, knee at 90°
- **Tight hip flexors:** Thigh lifts off table
- **Tight rectus femoris:** Knee straightens out

### Implications for Posture
Tight hip flexors pull pelvis into anterior tilt, increasing lower back curve.

---

## Hamstring Test

### Straight Leg Raise

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on back
2. Keep one leg flat on floor
3. Raise other leg straight up
4. Stop when you feel stretch or back wants to lift

**Results:**
- **Good:** 80-90 degrees
- **Limited:** Less than 70 degrees
- **Excellent:** Beyond 90 degrees

### Alternative: Toe Touch Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with feet together
2. Bend forward, reaching toward toes
3. Don't bounce
4. Note where hands reach

**Results:**
- **Good:** Touch toes or floor
- **Limited:** Can't reach past mid-shin
- **Excellent:** Palms on floor

### Implications for Posture
Tight hamstrings can contribute to posterior pelvic tilt and lower back rounding.

---

## Hip Rotation Test

### External Rotation (Seated)

**How to do it:**
1. Sit in chair, feet flat
2. Lift one ankle onto opposite knee (figure-4)
3. Note angle of lifted thigh

**Results:**
- **Good:** Thigh is roughly parallel to floor
- **Limited:** Thigh points up significantly
- **Very tight:** Unable to get ankle on knee

### Internal Rotation (Prone)

**How to do it:**
1. Lie face down
2. Bend knees to 90°
3. Let lower legs fall outward (feet apart)
4. Note angle

**Results:**
- **Normal:** About 35-45 degrees from vertical
- **Limited:** Less than 30 degrees

### Implications for Posture
Limited hip rotation affects walking, squatting, and sitting posture.

---

## Shoulder Flexibility Test

### Apley Scratch Test

**How to do it:**
1. Reach one arm over shoulder, down back
2. Reach other arm behind back, up toward shoulder
3. Try to touch fingers
4. Repeat switching arms

**Results:**
- **Good:** Fingers touch or overlap
- **Limited:** Gap between fingers
- **Very limited:** Large gap (6+ inches)

### Implications for Posture
Tight shoulders/chest contribute to rounded shoulder posture.

---

## Chest/Pec Flexibility Test

### Wall Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand in doorway
2. Place forearm on doorframe (elbow at 90°)
3. Step through gently
4. Note where you feel stretch

**Results:**
- **Good:** Can step through without intense stretch
- **Tight:** Strong stretch immediately
- **Very tight:** Unable to get arm in position

### Corner Stretch Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand facing corner
2. Forearms on walls at shoulder height
3. Lean in toward corner
4. Note chest tightness

### Implications for Posture
Tight pecs pull shoulders forward, contributing to kyphosis and forward head.

---

## Upper Back (Thoracic) Mobility Test

### Rotation Test

**How to do it:**
1. Sit in chair, cross arms over chest
2. Rotate torso to one side
3. Keep hips facing forward
4. Repeat other side

**Results:**
- **Good:** About 45-50 degrees rotation each way
- **Limited:** Less than 35 degrees
- **Asymmetric:** Big difference between sides

### Extension Test

**How to do it:**
1. Sit up straight
2. Place hands behind head
3. Gently extend backward
4. Note available movement

### Implications for Posture
Limited thoracic mobility contributes to kyphosis and compensations above and below.

---

## Neck Flexibility Test

### Rotation

**How to do it:**
1. Sit or stand tall
2. Turn head to look over one shoulder
3. Note how far you can see behind you
4. Repeat other side

**Results:**
- **Normal:** About 80 degrees (can almost look behind you)
- **Limited:** Less than 60 degrees

### Lateral Flexion

**How to do it:**
1. Sit or stand tall
2. Tilt ear toward shoulder (don't lift shoulder)
3. Note range
4. Repeat other side

**Results:**
- **Normal:** About 45 degrees
- **Limited:** Less than 30 degrees

### Implications for Posture
Limited neck mobility can indicate tightness affecting overall head/neck position.

---

## Calf Flexibility Test

### Wall Test

**How to do it:**
1. Face wall, hands on wall
2. One foot forward, one back
3. Back leg straight, heel on ground
4. Lean toward wall
5. Note how far back foot can be

**Results:**
- **Good:** Can maintain position with foot well back
- **Tight:** Heel lifts early or limited range

### Implications for Posture
Tight calves affect standing, walking, and squat mechanics.

## What to Do Next

### For Tight Areas

- Daily stretching (30-60 seconds per stretch)
- Focus on consistency
- Expect weeks/months for improvement
- Combine with strengthening

### When to Seek Help

- Significant asymmetry
- Pain with testing
- No improvement with consistent stretching
- Symptoms beyond tightness
