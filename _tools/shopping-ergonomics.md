# Shopping Ergonomics

> **Shopping Shouldn't Hurt:** Carrying heavy bags, pushing carts, and walking stores all challenge your posture. Here's how to shop without the shoulder and back pain.

---

## Carrying Bags

### The One-Sided Problem

Carrying bags on one side:
- Shifts weight off-center
- Causes compensatory lean
- Strains shoulder and back
- Repeated daily creates problems

### Better Bag Carrying

**Distribute weight:**
- Use both shoulders
- Switch sides frequently
- Balance bags between hands

**For shoulder bags:**
- Crossbody is better than one shoulder
- Keep bag close to body
- Don't let it hang at hip level

**For hand-carried bags:**
- Two bags, one per hand
- Switch hands every few minutes
- Don't overload any single bag

## Handbag/Purse Habits

### The Weight Problem

Average purse weighs 5-7 lbs—some much more.

**Consequences:**
- Shoulder elevation
- Uneven wear
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Upper back tension

### Solutions

- Empty regularly
- Carry essentials only
- Ask: do I need this today?

**Better bags:**
- Crossbody when possible

**Technique:**

## Grocery Shopping

### In the Store

**Cart pushing:**
- Push with both arms
- Keep elbows slightly bent
- Don't lean on cart

**Reaching:**

- Ask for help with heavy items
- Squat for low shelves (don't bend over)

**Loading cart:**

- Don't overload

### Bagging

**At checkout:**

- Multiple light bags > few heavy bags

### Carrying to Car

**One trip isn't worth it:**
- Multiple trips with lighter loads
- Use cart all the way to car
- Reusable bags with handles help

**From cart to car:**

### Bringing Groceries In

**Best approach:**
