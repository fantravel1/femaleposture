# Commuter Posture

> **The Daily Grind:** Commuting on public transit presents unique challenges—standing on moving vehicles, cramped seating, and heavy bags. Here's how to protect your posture on the way to work.

---

## General Commute Principles

### The Challenges

- Standing for extended periods
- Uneven surfaces (moving vehicles)
- Cramped seating
- Heavy bags/backpacks
- Phone use while commuting
- Rush hour crowding

### Core Strategy

- Minimize load weight
- Distribute weight evenly
- Change positions frequently
- Maintain awareness
- Use commute time wisely

---

## Standing on Transit

### Position

**Feet:**
- Hip-width apart or wider
- Staggered stance for stability
- Knees slightly bent

**Body:**
- Core engaged for balance
- Weight centered
- Not leaning heavily on pole

**Upper body:**
- Shoulders back and down
- Head neutral
- If holding overhead rail, switch arms

### Holding On

**One hand:**
- Switch hands regularly
- Avoid hanging from same arm whole trip
- Keep shoulder down (don't shrug)

**Two hands (if possible):**
- Better stability
- More even distribution

### Standing Long Rides

- Shift weight between legs
- Do subtle calf raises
- Squeeze and release glutes
- Change position at stops

---

## Sitting on Transit

### Getting a Seat

- Sit rather than stand when possible
- But give up seat if needed by others
- Balance your own needs with courtesy

### Seated Position

**If seat allows:**
- Sit back against seat
- Feet flat on floor
- Don't cross legs for extended periods
- Bag on lap or floor (not pulling on shoulder)

### Cramped Seating

**When space is limited:**
- Maintain what alignment you can
- Engage core to support
- Avoid extreme slouch
- Switch leg crossing if you do it

### Phone/Reading Use

- Raise device toward face
- Don't look down the whole ride
- Take breaks from screen
- Switch arms holding device

## Bag Management

### Backpacks

**Best for commuting:**
- Distributes weight on both shoulders
- Keeps hands free
- Allows better posture

**Tips:**
- Use both straps always
- Adjust straps so bag is snug
- Heavier items close to back
- Don't overload
- Remove at crowded peak times

### Shoulder Bags

**Challenges:**
- One-sided weight
- Shoulder hiking
- Posture compensation

**If you must:**
- Crossbody is better than single shoulder
- Keep bag close to body
- Switch sides during commute
- Keep bag light

### Tote Bags / Briefcases

**Challenges:**
- Hand carrying is tiring
- One-sided strain

**Tips:**
- Switch hands frequently
- Keep as light as possible
- Consider bag with wheels
