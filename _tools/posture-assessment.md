# Posture Self-Assessment: Check Your Alignment

> **Know Your Starting Point:** Before you can improve your posture, you need to understand where you're starting. This assessment helps you identify your specific posture patterns.

---

## What You'll Need

- Full-length mirror
- Wall
- Smartphone (for photos)
- Pencil and paper (to record observations)
- Comfortable clothing

---

## Standing Posture Assessment

### Wall Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Heels about 4 inches from wall
3. Buttocks and shoulder blades should touch wall
4. Try to touch head to wall

**What to note:**
- Can you touch head to wall naturally?
- How much space is between lower back and wall?
- Does it feel comfortable or strained?

**What it means:**
- Large gap at lower back → Possible anterior pelvic tilt
- Head doesn't reach wall → Forward head posture
- Shoulders don't touch → Rounded shoulders
- Position feels very unnatural → Significant posture deviations

### Side View Assessment

**How to do it:**
1. Stand sideways to mirror (or have someone take photo)
2. Stand naturally—don't try to "fix" your posture
3. Observe alignment

**Ideal alignment (imaginary plumb line):**
- Through ear
- Through shoulder
- Through hip
- Slightly behind knee
- Through ankle

**What to note:**
- Is head forward of shoulders?
- Are shoulders rounded forward?
- Is there excessive lower back curve?
- Is pelvis tilted forward or back?

### Front View Assessment

**How to do it:**
1. Face the mirror
2. Stand naturally
3. Observe symmetry

**What to note:**
- Is one shoulder higher than the other?
- Is head tilted to one side?
- Are hips level?
- Do feet point straight or turn out?
- Is weight equal on both feet?

### Back View Assessment

**How to do it:**
1. Have someone take photo from behind
2. Or use timer and position camera

**What to note:**
- Is spine straight?
- Are shoulder blades even?
- Is one hip higher?
- Any visible curvature?

## Specific Posture Tests

### Forward Head Posture Test

**Wall test:**
1. Stand against wall
2. Note: Can you touch head to wall without straining or tilting chin up?

**Photo test:**
1. Photo from side
2. Draw vertical line from shoulder
3. Is ear forward of this line?

**Degree of forward head:**
- Mild: 1 inch forward
- Moderate: 2 inches forward
- Severe: 3+ inches forward

### Rounded Shoulders Test

**Pencil test:**
1. Stand naturally with arms at sides
2. Let hands hang naturally
3. Which way do palms face?

**Results:**
- Palms face thighs → Good
- Palms face backward → Rounded shoulders

**Door frame test:**
1. Stand in doorway
2. Place forearms against frame
3. Lean forward
4. Feel stretch in chest?

If yes, chest muscles may be tight (contributing to rounded shoulders).

### Anterior Pelvic Tilt Test

**Visual:**
1. Stand sideways to mirror
2. Observe belt line
3. Does front of pelvis tilt down?

**Thomas test (simplified):**
1. Lie on back at edge of bed
2. Pull one knee to chest
3. Let other leg hang off edge
4. Does hanging thigh rise up?

If yes, hip flexors may be tight (indicating possible APT).

**Swayback check:**
- In the wall test, if you have a large gap that fits more than your hand, you may have excessive lordosis.

### Thoracic Kyphosis Check

**Observation:**
- Is upper back excessively rounded?
- Can you straighten fully?
- Any "hump" appearance?

**Test:**
1. Lie face down
2. Prop on forearms
3. Can you extend upper back?
4. Is there stiffness or restriction?

---

## Seated Posture Assessment

**Natural sitting:**
1. Sit in your usual chair
2. Don't try to correct
3. Observe or photograph

**What to note:**
- Do you slouch?
- Is head forward?
- Are shoulders rounded?
- Is back supported?
- Where do you carry tension?

---

## Movement Assessments

### Overhead Reach Test

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Raise arms overhead
3. Try to touch wall with back of hands

**What to note:**
- Can arms reach wall?
- Does lower back arch off wall?
- Is there restriction or pain?

**What it means:**
- Arms don't reach → Tight shoulders/chest
- Back arches → Core weakness, tight lats
- Pain → See a professional

### Squat Test (Posture Implications)

**How to do it:**
1. Squat as low as comfortable
2. Arms forward for balance

**What to note:**
- Does back round excessively?
- Do heels lift?
- Do knees cave in?
- Any asymmetry?

**Posture connections:**
- Rounded back → Possible hip or ankle mobility issues
- Heels lift → Tight calves
- Knees caving → Hip weakness

## Recording Your Assessment

### Create a Baseline

**Take photos:**
- Front view
- Side view (both sides)
- Back view
- Date the photos

**Write notes on:**
- What you observed
- What tests showed
- Any pain or discomfort
- What feels tight
- What feels weak

### Reassess Regularly

**Frequency:**
- Monthly photos (same positions, lighting)
- Weekly subjective check-in
- After 3-6 months of exercise, repeat all tests

---

## What Your Assessment Tells You

### Common Posture Patterns

**Upper Crossed Syndrome:**
- Forward head
- Rounded shoulders
- Tight chest and neck
- Weak upper back and deep neck flexors

**Lower Crossed Syndrome:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt
- Tight hip flexors and lower back
- Weak abs and glutes

**Flat Back:**
- Reduced curves
- Pelvis tucked under
- Different set of imbalances

### Prioritizing Issues

If you have multiple issues:
1. Address what causes pain first
2. Then most visible issues
3. Work on everything gradually

## Limitations of Self-Assessment

### When to Seek Professional Evaluation

- Significant pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Obvious asymmetry
- No improvement with exercise
- History of injury or surgery
- Concerned about scoliosis

### Professionals Who Can Help

- Physical therapist
- Chiropractor
- Orthopedist
- Sports medicine doctor
- Certified postural specialist

---

## Using Your Assessment

### Plan Your Approach

Based on findings:
1. Identify tight areas → Need stretching
2. Identify weak areas → Need strengthening
3. Identify habits → Need awareness and change

### Track Progress

- Retake photos monthly
- Redo tests every 6-8 weeks
- Note subjective improvements
- Celebrate progress
