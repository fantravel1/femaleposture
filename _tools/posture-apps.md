### Common Mistakes

- Buying tech instead of doing exercises
- Relying solely on devices
- Ignoring the fundamentals
- Overcomplicating with too many tools

---

## A Simple Tech Approach

### Minimum Effective Dose

1. **One reminder system** (phone alarm or simple app)
2. **One exercise resource** (this website, a yoga app, or similar)
3. **Optional:** Basic tracking (photos monthly)

### That's Often Enough

- Complexity can reduce follow-through
- Simple tools used consistently beat sophisticated ones ignored
- Focus on doing the work

---

## Making Technology Work

### Keys to Success

1. **Choose one or two tools**
2. **Set up and forget** (make it automatic)
3. **Actually respond** to reminders
4. **Review periodically** (is it helping?)
5. **Don't rely solely on tech**

### Combine With

- Knowledge (understanding why)
- Exercises (doing the work)
- Environment changes (ergonomics)
- Professional guidance (if needed)
