## Patterns to Look For

### Time Patterns

- Worse in morning = May be sleep position
- Worse by end of day = May be work posture
- Worse on weekdays = May be work-related
- Worse on weekends = May be activity-related
- Cyclical with period = Hormonal component

### Activity Patterns

- Worse after sitting = Need more breaks
- Worse after exercise = May need form check
- Worse after stress = Tension component
- Worse with specific activity = Modify that activity

### Progress Patterns

- Gradual improvement = Keep doing what you're doing
- Plateaus = May need to adjust approach
- Worsening despite efforts = See provider
- Fluctuating = Identify variables
