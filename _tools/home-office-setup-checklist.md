# Home Office Setup Checklist

> **Your Home Is Now Your Workplace:** Unlike offices, home setups are rarely ergonomically designed. This checklist helps you create a workspace that protects your posture.

---

## Quick Assessment

### Current Problem Signs

Check if you experience:
- [ ] Neck pain after work
- [ ] Lower back discomfort
- [ ] Shoulder/upper back tension
- [ ] Headaches in afternoon
- [ ] Wrist or hand pain
- [ ] Eye strain
- [ ] Fatigue by mid-day

If you checked any, your setup needs work.

## The Chair

### Essentials

- [ ] **Height adjustable** to allow feet flat on floor
- [ ] **Seat depth** allows 2-3 fingers between seat edge and back of knees
- [ ] **Back support** that matches your spine curve
- [ ] **Armrests** at height where shoulders stay relaxed

### Optimal Settings

- [ ] Feet flat on floor (or on footrest)
- [ ] Thighs parallel to floor
- [ ] Hips at 90-100 degrees
- [ ] Back fully supported
- [ ] Lumbar curve supported
- [ ] Armrests supporting forearms at desk height

### If Your Chair Doesn't Adjust

**Add-on solutions:**
- [ ] Seat cushion to adjust height
- [ ] Lumbar roll or pillow for back support
- [ ] Footrest if feet don't reach floor
- [ ] Arm supports that attach to desk

### Red Flags

- Chair is too soft/unsupportive
- Sitting on couch or bed to work
- Bar stool or dining chair without support
- Chair height cannot be adjusted

---

## The Desk

### Height

- [ ] **Seated:** Elbows at 90 degrees when typing
- [ ] **Standing:** Same—elbows at 90 degrees
- [ ] Wrists neutral, not bent up or down
- [ ] Shoulders relaxed, not shrugged

### Standard Heights

- Seated desk: 28-30 inches for most people
- May need adjustment based on your height
- Keyboard tray can help if desk is too high

### Surface Space

- [ ] Enough room for monitor at proper distance
- [ ] Space for keyboard and mouse at same level
- [ ] Room to keep frequently used items within reach
- [ ] Not cluttered with non-essential items

### Adjustable Desk Options

---

## The Monitor

### Height

- [ ] Top of screen at or slightly below eye level

- [ ] Full screen visible without excessive eye movement

### Angle

### Solutions for Problems

**Too low:**
