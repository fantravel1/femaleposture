# Postpartum Recovery Timeline

> **Healing Takes Time:** Your body grew a human—recovery isn't instant. This timeline helps you understand what to expect and when to reintroduce activity safely.

---

## Important Notes First

### Individual Variation

- Recovery varies widely between women
- Birth method affects timeline
- Previous fitness matters
- Listen to YOUR body
- Get provider clearance for exercise

### C-Section Recovery

- Major abdominal surgery
- Generally slower timeline
- Different precautions
- Usually 6-8 weeks before cleared for exercise
- Sometimes longer

---

---

## Weeks 4-6: Building Foundation

---

## 6-Week Checkup

### What Gets Assessed

- Uterus returned to size
- Healing from birth
- Bleeding stopped
- General recovery

### What to Ask About

- Exercise clearance
- Pelvic floor assessment referral
- Specific limitations for you
- When to return if concerns

### Getting Cleared

"Cleared for exercise" means:
- Light-moderate activity okay
- Not "back to normal"
- Still need gradual progression
- Listen to your body

---

## Weeks 6-12: Gradual Return

### What's Happening

- Body still adapting

### What You Can Do

**Exercise:**
- Longer walks
- Swimming (when bleeding stopped)
- Light resistance training

**Start slowly:**

- Gradually increase
- Stop if pain
- Rest as needed

### Watch For

- Pain during/after exercise
- Leaking urine with activity
- Feeling of heaviness in pelvis
- Bleeding returning
- Coning of abdomen during exercise

---

## Months 3-6: Building Strength

### What's Happening

- More consistent energy
- Body continuing to adapt
- May be ready for more
- Sleep may improve (or not!)

### What You Can Do

**Exercise:**
- Longer duration sessions
- Moderate intensity

**Progression:**

---

## Months 6-12: Continued Recovery

### What's Happening

**Continue:**
- Pelvic floor maintenance
- Core strengthening
- Gradual progression

### When to Reassess

- Persistent pelvic floor symptoms
- Diastasis not improving
- Pain with activity
- Plateau in recovery

---

## Special Considerations

### Diastasis Recti

**What it is:**
- Separation of rectus abdominis
- Common in pregnancy
- Doesn't always resolve alone

**What helps:**
- Proper core rehabilitation
- Avoiding exercises that worsen
- PT assessment and guidance
- Time (months to improve)

### Pelvic Floor Dysfunction

**Signs:**
- Leaking urine
- Urgency
- Heaviness/prolapse feeling
- Pain

**What helps:**
- Pelvic floor PT
- Appropriate exercises
- Addressing root cause
- Time and consistency

### C-Section Recovery

**Additional considerations:**
- Scar tissue mobilization
- Core reconnection takes longer
- Nerve sensation changes
- Gentler progression

---

## Red Flags

### See Provider If

- Fever
- Excessive bleeding
- Foul-smelling discharge
- Signs of infection
- Depression/anxiety severe
- Pain that's worsening

### During Exercise

- Pain (stop activity)
- Heavy bleeding
- Leaking urine regularly
- Severe fatigue
- Dizziness

---

## Realistic Expectations

### What's Normal

- Feeling different than before
- Taking 6-12+ months for "recovery"
- Some things changing permanently
- Need for modifications
- Body looking/feeling different

### What's Not Normal

- Persistent significant pain
- Unable to control bladder/bowel
- Progressive symptoms
- Severe mental health struggles

### Be Kind to Yourself

- You created life
- Recovery is not a race
- Comparison is unhelpful
- Progress is not linear
- Rest is productive
