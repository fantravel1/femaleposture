# The Wall Test: Quick Posture Assessment

> **Why This Test:** The wall test gives you immediate feedback about key postural deviations. In 30 seconds, you can identify patterns that may need attention. Use it regularly to track your progress.

---

## What You'll Need

- A flat wall (no molding at floor level, if possible)
- Bare feet or socks
- Form-fitting clothing (helps you see what's happening)
- Optional: mirror beside you, or ask someone to observe

---

## How to Perform the Wall Test

### Step 1: Position Yourself

1. Stand with your back to the wall
2. Place heels about 2-3 inches from the wall
3. Let your body relax—don't force any position

### Step 2: Make Contact

Let these parts touch the wall (if they will naturally):
- Buttocks
- Shoulder blades
- Back of head

**Important:** Don't force contact. Note what touches naturally and what doesn't.

### Step 3: Check Your Lower Back

1. Slide your hand between your lower back and the wall
2. Note how much space there is

## What Your Results Mean

### Lower Back Gap

| Finding | Indicates | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Flat hand fits** | Normal lumbar curve | Good alignment here |
| **More than hand thickness** | Excessive lordosis (anterior pelvic tilt) | See [APT Guide](/conditions/anterior-pelvic-tilt/complete-guide/) |
| **Fingers don't fit** | Reduced lumbar curve (flat back or posterior tilt) | May need to address posterior tilt |

### Head Position

| Finding | Indicates | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Head touches naturally** | Good head alignment | Maintain this |
| **Head doesn't touch** | Forward head posture | See [FHP Guide](/conditions/forward-head-posture/complete-guide/) |
| **Need to tilt chin up to touch** | Significant FHP | Same—work on chin tucks and posture |

### Shoulder Position

| Finding | Indicates | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Shoulder blades touch easily** | Good shoulder position | Maintain this |
| **Shoulder blades barely touch** | Mild rounding | Chest stretches, back strengthening |
| **Shoulder blades don't touch** | Significant rounded shoulders | See [Rounded Shoulders Guide](/conditions/rounded-shoulders/complete-guide/) |

## The Full Assessment Checklist

Run through this complete checklist:

### At the Wall

- [ ] Heels 2-3 inches from wall
- [ ] Buttocks touching wall
- [ ] Shoulder blades touching wall
- [ ] Back of head touching wall (without tilting chin up)
- [ ] Lower back gap is approximately one hand thickness
- [ ] Shoulders are relaxed (not shrugged)
- [ ] Position feels achievable (not straining)

### What to Note

- Which contact points are difficult?
- Is one side different from the other?
- Does the position feel very different from your normal?

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Everything Touches, Large Lower Back Gap

**What it means:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt (common)
- Hip flexors likely tight
- Glutes may be weak

**Priority actions:**
1. Hip flexor stretching
2. Glute strengthening
3. Core exercises
4. Pelvic tilt awareness

### Pattern 2: Head Doesn't Touch

**What it means:**
- Forward head posture
- Often accompanied by rounded shoulders
- Deep neck flexors likely weak

**Priority actions:**
1. Chin tuck exercises
2. Neck stretches
3. Upper back strengthening
4. Workstation assessment

### Pattern 3: Shoulders Don't Touch

**What it means:**
- Rounded shoulders
- Tight chest muscles
- Weak upper back muscles

**Priority actions:**
1. Chest stretching (doorway stretch)
2. Upper back strengthening
3. Wall angels
4. Posture awareness

### Pattern 4: Can Barely Get Into Position

**What it means:**
- Multiple postural deviations
- Significant tightness
- May need comprehensive approach

**Priority actions:**
1. Start with easiest corrections
2. Consider professional assessment
3. Consistent daily work
4. Be patient—changes take time

### Pattern 5: Everything Touches Easily

**What it means:**
- Good static posture
- Keep up what you're doing
- Focus on dynamic posture and endurance

**Priority actions:**
1. Maintain current practices
2. Focus on movement quality
3. Prevent regression
4. Monitor periodically

## Using the Wall Test for Training

Beyond assessment, use the wall as a training tool:

### Wall Posture Holds

1. Get into good wall position
2. Hold for 30-60 seconds
3. Breathe normally
4. Step away and try to maintain position
5. How long can you hold good posture without wall?

### Wall Chin Tucks

1. Stand against wall
2. Retract chin, trying to press head into wall
3. Hold 5-10 seconds
4. 10 reps
5. More challenging than regular chin tucks

### Wall Angels

1. Against wall, arms in "goal post" position
2. Slide arms up and down
3. Keep all contact points on wall
4. Great for mobility and strength

## Tracking Progress

### How Often to Test

- Full assessment: Every 4-6 weeks
- Quick check: Weekly
- Training position: Daily

### What Improvement Looks Like

**Week 0:** Head 2 inches from wall
**Week 4:** Head barely touches with effort
**Week 8:** Head touches with moderate effort
**Week 12:** Head touches naturally

### Recording Your Results

Track these metrics:
1. Head-to-wall distance (or contact Y/N)
2. Shoulder blade contact (easy/moderate/difficult/impossible)
3. Lower back gap (finger count)
4. Overall difficulty rating (1-10)
5. Date

## When Results Don't Improve

If you're working consistently but not seeing changes:

### Check Your Approach

- Are you doing exercises correctly?
- Are you consistent (daily, not weekly)?
- Are you addressing the right issues?

### Consider

- Professional assessment
- Physical therapy
- Different exercise selection
- Underlying issues (joint problems, etc.)

### Don't Forget

- Progress is often slow
- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Address lifestyle factors (desk setup, phone habits, etc.)

---

## Limitations of the Wall Test

### What It Shows

- Static posture alignment
- General patterns and deviations
- Changes over time

### What It Doesn't Show

- Dynamic posture (how you move)
- Muscle strength or weakness
- Root causes
- Subtle asymmetries

### It's a Starting Point

The wall test is useful but not comprehensive. Use it alongside:
- Full posture assessment
- Movement screening
- Professional evaluation if needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do the wall test?

A full assessment every 4-6 weeks is enough to track progress. You can do quick checks more frequently.

### What if I can get into position but can't maintain it?

This indicates you have the range of motion but lack the strength/endurance. Focus on strengthening exercises and posture practice.

### Is it normal if this feels very uncomfortable?

Mild discomfort adjusting to a new position is normal. Sharp pain is not—stop and consult a provider if needed.

### Should my whole back touch the wall?

No. Natural curves mean there are spaces. The small of your back (lumbar) will not touch. Upper back and buttocks should.
