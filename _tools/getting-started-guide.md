# Getting Started: Your First Week of Posture Work

> **Welcome:** You've decided to improve your posture. This guide takes you through your first seven days with simple, manageable steps. No overwhelm—just steady progress.

---

## Before You Begin

### What You'll Need

- A full-length mirror (or phone camera)
- A yoga mat or soft floor surface
- 10-15 minutes per day
- A notebook or phone for tracking (optional)

### Mindset

- Small steps lead to big changes
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- There's no "perfect" posture—we're aiming for comfortable and sustainable
- Progress takes weeks to months, not days

---

## Day 1: Assessment and Awareness

### Task 1: Take Photos (5 minutes)

Have someone take photos of you, or use timer/mirror:
- Front view, standing naturally
- Side view, standing naturally
- Don't "pose"—stand as you normally would

Save these. You'll compare in 30 days.

### Task 2: The Wall Test (2 minutes)

1. Stand with heels 2-3 inches from wall
2. Touch buttocks and shoulder blades to wall
3. Check: Does your head touch? Is there a big gap behind your lower back?

Just notice. No judgment.

### Task 3: Notice Throughout Day

Set 3 phone reminders for today:
- Morning, midday, afternoon
- When reminder goes off, just notice your posture
- Where are you? How are you sitting/standing?

**That's it for Day 1.** Awareness is the foundation.

---

## Day 2: Learn the Basics

### Task 1: Find Your Neutral Spine (3 minutes)

**Standing:**
1. Stand feet hip-width apart
2. Rock forward on toes, then back on heels
3. Find the middle—balanced on whole foot
4. Let knees be soft (not locked)
5. Gently engage your core
6. Roll shoulders back and down
7. Imagine a string pulling top of head up
8. This is your neutral standing posture

**Sitting:**
1. Sit on edge of a firm chair
2. Rock your pelvis forward (arching back) and back (rounding)
3. Find the middle—balanced on sitting bones
4. Feet flat, knees at 90 degrees
5. Stack your spine up from there
6. This is your neutral sitting posture

### Task 2: Learn Chin Tucks (5 minutes)

The most fundamental posture exercise:
1. Sit or stand tall
2. Look straight ahead
3. Draw your chin straight back (not down)
4. You'll make a "double chin"—that's right
5. Hold 5 seconds
6. Release
7. Repeat 10 times

Do this 3 times today.

### Task 3: Posture Checks

Continue your 3 reminder checks. Notice + now try to gently correct using what you learned.

---

## Day 3: Add Stretching

### Task 1: Chin Tucks (5 minutes)

3 sets of 10 throughout the day. You know this now.

### Task 2: Learn Doorway Stretch (5 minutes)

Opens tight chest muscles:
1. Stand in a doorway
2. Place forearms on door frame
3. Elbows at shoulder height
4. Step one foot forward through doorway
5. Lean gently forward until you feel stretch across chest
6. Hold 30 seconds
7. Try at different elbow heights (higher, lower)
8. Do 3 sets of 30 seconds

### Task 3: Learn Neck Side Stretch (3 minutes)

1. Drop right ear toward right shoulder
2. Keep left shoulder down
3. For more stretch, gently press head with right hand
4. Hold 30 seconds
5. Switch sides
6. Do each side twice

### Task 4: Continue Posture Checks

You know the drill. Notice, correct, move on.

## Day 4: Add Movement

- Neck stretches: 30 seconds each side

### Task 2: Learn Cat-Cow (5 minutes)

Spinal mobility exercise:
1. Get on hands and knees
2. Hands under shoulders, knees under hips
3. **Cow:** Inhale, drop belly, lift chest and tailbone, look up
4. **Cat:** Exhale, round spine up, tuck chin, tuck tailbone
5. Flow between them slowly
6. 10-15 cycles

### Task 3: Take Movement Breaks

Today, add movement to your posture checks:
- When reminder goes off, stand up
- Do 3-5 shoulder rolls
- Walk for 30 seconds
- Then sit with good posture

## Day 5: Add Strengthening

## Day 7: Reflect and Plan

### Task 1: Full Routine

Do your complete routine again.

### Task 2: Compare to Day 1 (5 minutes)

- How does the wall test feel now?
- Are you more aware of your posture?
- What's easier? What's still hard?

Don't expect major visible changes in one week. You're building the foundation.

### Task 3: Plan Your Week 2

Decide when you'll do your routine:
- Morning? Evening? Both?
- Set a consistent time
- Mark it on your calendar

### Task 4: Track Progress

Start simple tracking:

- How did I feel?
- What did I notice?

## Common First-Week Questions

### Is it normal to feel sore?

Mild muscle soreness from new exercises is normal. Sharp pain is not. Rest if needed, modify if exercises hurt.

### How do I remember to do this?

- Set phone reminders
- Link to existing habits (after brushing teeth)
- Put your mat where you'll see it
- Prepare the night before

### I missed a day. Now what?

Just do the next day. Missing one day doesn't ruin anything. Missing multiple weeks does. Get back on track quickly.

### I'm not seeing changes yet.

Week 1 is about building habits and awareness. Visible changes typically start around week 4-6. Be patient.
