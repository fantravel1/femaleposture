# Shoes for Better Posture

> **Foundation Matters:** Your posture starts at your feet. The wrong shoes can cause problems that radiate up through your knees, hips, and spine. Here's how to choose footwear that supports your body.

---

## How Shoes Affect Posture

### The Chain Reaction

Your foot position affects:
- **Ankle alignment** → Knee tracking
- **Knee position** → Hip alignment
- **Hip alignment** → Pelvic tilt
- **Pelvic tilt** → Spinal curves
- **Spine** → Head position

Poor footwear = compensations all the way up.

### Common Shoe-Related Problems

- Lower back pain
- Hip pain
- Knee problems
- Foot pain (plantar fasciitis, bunions)
- Calf tightness
- Overall fatigue

---

## Key Features for Good Shoes

### 1. Proper Fit

**Width:**
- Toes can spread naturally
- Not squeezing at widest part
- Not too loose (foot slides)

**Length:**
- Thumb-width from longest toe to end
- Feet swell during day—buy for evening size
- Both feet measured (often different sizes)

**Heel:**
- Snug, not slipping
- Not rubbing
- Centered in heel cup

### 2. Arch Support

**Why it matters:**
- Supports foot structure
- Prevents overpronation/supination
- Reduces fatigue

**Know your arch:**
- Flat: Need more support
- Normal: Moderate support
- High: Cushioning and some support

### 3. Cushioning

**Where needed:**
- Heel (impact absorption)
- Forefoot (push-off cushioning)
- Overall (standing comfort)

**Too much vs. too little:**
- Too much can destabilize
- Too little causes fatigue
- Match to activity

### 4. Heel Height

**Optimal for posture:**
- Low (0.5-1.5 inches)
- Small heel actually helps many people
- Completely flat can strain some feet

**Problems with high heels:**
- Forward weight shift
- Shortened calf muscles
- Increased lumbar curve
- Ball-of-foot pressure

### 5. Stability

**What to look for:**
- Firm heel counter
- Supportive midsole
- Doesn't twist easily
- Stable base

## Shoes by Category

### Work/Professional Shoes

**For standing/walking work:**
- Cushioned, supportive insole
- Low, wide heel
- Breathable materials
- Room for toes
- Anti-fatigue features

**For desk work:**
- Can be less supportive (sitting more)
- Still need good fit
- Consider slipping them off at desk
- Have supportive option for walking

**Professional appearance options:**
- Low-heeled loafers
- Supportive flats
- Derby shoes
- Wedges (more stable than stilettos)
- Block heels

### Athletic Shoes

**Running shoes:**
- Match to your gait (neutral, stability, motion control)
- Get fitted at running store
- Replace every 300-500 miles
- Don't use old, worn-out shoes

**Training/gym shoes:**
- More stable base than running shoes
- Good for lateral movements
- Less cushion, more ground feel
- Flat for lifting if you lift weights

**Walking shoes:**
- Similar to running but often stiffer
- Good heel-toe transition
- Cushioned but stable
- Breathable for longer wear

### Everyday Casual

**Sneakers:**
- All the same rules apply
- Don't sacrifice support for style
- Many stylish, supportive options exist

**Flats:**
- Most have zero support
- Look for cushioned, supportive options
- Consider adding insoles
- Not for prolonged standing

**Sandals:**
- Need arch support (most lack it)
- Look for contoured footbeds
- Thong style forces toe gripping
- Better: strapped with arch support

**Boots:**
- Low, wide heel
- Room for toes
- Ankle support can help
- Heavy boots can cause fatigue

### High Heels

**If you wear them:**
- Lower is better (under 2 inches)
- Wider heel is more stable
- Platform reduces effective height
- Limit wearing time
- Stretch calves after

**Better heel options:**
- Block heels (more stable)
- Wedges (distribute pressure)
- Kitten heels (very low)
- Chunky platforms

**Worst for posture:**
- Stilettos
- Very high heels (3+ inches)
- Narrow toe boxes
- Stiff, unforgiving materials
