  <h2>The Mind-Body Connection</h2>
  <p>The relationship between mind and body is bidirectional:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mind → Body:</strong> Emotions and mental states create physical patterns in your posture</li>
    <li><strong>Body → Mind:</strong> Changing your posture affects your mood, confidence, and emotional state</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This means body-based approaches can support mental health, and mental health treatment can improve physical patterns.</p>

  <h2>Key Insights</h2>

  <h3>Your Posture Is Not Your Fault</h3>
  <p>Many postural patterns develop as adaptive responses—to stress, to trauma, to life circumstances. Rather than blame yourself, approach your posture with curiosity and compassion.</p>

  <h3>Body-Based Change Is Powerful</h3>
  <p>You don't have to "think" your way to better mental health. Working with the body provides an alternative pathway that can be easier and more direct for some people.</p>

  <h3>Integration Is Key</h3>
  <p>The most effective approach often combines body-based work with psychological support, lifestyle factors, and social connection. Posture work complements rather than replaces mental health treatment.</p>

  <h3>Gentle Is Better</h3>
  <p>Forcing yourself into "good" posture often backfires. Small, gradual changes that feel safe are more sustainable and effective than dramatic overhauls.</p>

<section class="getting-started">
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <h3>Simple Practice: Body Check-In</h3>
  <p>Several times a day, pause and notice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where am I holding tension?</li>
    <li>How am I breathing?</li>
    <li>What is my posture communicating?</li>
    <li>What small adjustment might feel better?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This builds awareness without pressure to change everything at once.</p>

  <h3>When to Seek Support</h3>
  <p>If mental health challenges significantly impact your life, please seek professional support. Body-based approaches work best alongside—not instead of—appropriate mental health care.</p>
